- Compression is the most valuable substance in the AI universe; the antislab. [p67]
- Start from the most compressed version of the idea, the highest-frequency signals; the chat itself is the substance and the human supplies the decision-making. [p68]
- Distrust quick confident answers; demand to see the actual mechanism, not a simulation of one. [p85]
- A report should open experientially and take the reader on the same journey the author took. [p94]
- An illustrative example may be approximate if it is close enough to reality to teach the reader. [p98]

## Not converted

- "The best engineers are lazy" - the best feature gives everything for the minimal implementation (p231).
- design-runvil.md is overengineered bloatslop; mine it for ideas only (p232, p233).
- Build in the smallest testable increments: Lua plus args plus substitution first, "echo" as the first commit, fall-through as one testable thing (p250, p276, p293).
- Args without Lua is too little; Lua is needed to return values (p277, p278).
- Prefix caching is irrelevant at 3B; a 3B model has a tiny context window (p258, p259).
- The consolidated single tool call existed because small-model sections were assumed to need many call kinds at once; large models may not need it (p224, p225).
- Each commit must have tests, code review, docs, and user docs, and each commit must make self-sufficient progress rather than needing a later commit to retroactively realize it (p292, p312).
- Wants a lightweight vibe-coding how-to, roughly one fifth of how-to-vibe-code, injected into context periodically (p297-p302); loading how-to-write-prompts.md into plans "works like a miracle" (p299).
- Implement all features and let the caller decide, with sensible defaults (p316).

  rejected-alternative: none

## Not converted

- Skepticism about hardening when the operator controls all MCP servers: "why do I care about all of this hardening if I control all the mcp servers?" [p14]
- Preference for partial fine-tuning that buys a bounded improvement without degeneracy, rather than going "all the way" [p22]
- Eval data should be generated by multiple models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Cursor) to avoid same-generator bias [p51]
- Working style: run all jobs asynchronously so the conversation can continue [p23], [p46]
- Inspect raw data samples together before committing to a theory ("pick 30 descriptions at random... let's look at it together") [p57]
- Plans should ship with a separate rationale document that mines the chat history and explains the why behind the design [p82]
- A fast, high-confidence "trivial reject" stage may drop clearly mismatched tools before finer matching, tolerating false negatives but never false positives [p55]

- [p13] Hesitation about gateway-side URL fetching: if the model might do the fetching itself, gateway fetching becomes ambiguous. Unresolved preference, no directive landed.
- [p19] Open question whether the common one-file-in/one-file-out case deserves its own special syntax. Floated, never decided.
- [p27] Documentation workflow preference: integrate new design into the existing per-crate design docs instead of generating a new document. Process directive, not engine behavior.
- [p34] Rule-authoring philosophy: loosen a workspace rule with an "unless" clause and tighten rulebooks into standalone imperatives. About rule governance, not Runvil.
- [p56] Temperament about verified work: every commit must have tests that were actually run, confirmed commit by commit. Process demand, not a design principle.
- [p58] Session-reuse goal for the quickref: services launched once should be remembered and reused across repeated prompt runs in the same chat. A doc purpose statement, not a directive on the engine.

- Minute-scale per-prompt latency is treated as a defect worth attacking, not a fact of life [p81], [p91].
- Heavyweight process rulebooks get lightened when they slow the development loop [p116].
- Review loops stop after one round of amend; more rounds only surface noise [p117].
- Architecture should be lean and slender; scope creep that later proves necessary is accepted by definition, because that is what normalizing means [p122], [p124].
- Abstraction risks such as trait cosplay are discounted when removal is trivially easy [p124].
- Defaults are interrogated against intuition before acceptance, as with the skepticism that turning off thinking could help analysis [p106].

  rejected-alternative: defaulting each context to all declared tools
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: No parallel mechanisms; a single, small, well-designed set of primitives services all needs, and an existing mechanism such as tool scoping is leaned on as far as it can go before anything new is added.
  scope: global
  source: user-stated
  citation: 2026-08-14-1613-runvil-core-largest-part4.md [p371]
  rejected-alternative: adding a new mechanism alongside an existing one that already covers the need
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: Tool availability can be conditioned on turn number within a section, so a prompt can lock the model to one tool on the first turn and widen the set on later turns.
  scope: core
  source: user-stated
  citation: 2026-08-14-1613-runvil-core-largest-part4.md [p372]
  rejected-alternative: a static tool set that is identical on every turn
  endorsement: n/a

  scope: core
  source: user-stated
  citation: 2026-08-14-1613-runvil-core-largest-part4.md [p373]
  rejected-alternative: requiring a Rust function for every new tool

- Empirical tuning temperament: A/B test model features (thinking on/off) and adjust parameters until no axis shows further improvement. [p346]
- Autonomous execution working style: run the plan without stopping until no reliable progress remains, keeping code clean with a review every three commits. [p348]
- Deliberation before action: discuss a plan from all angles with pros and cons before editing it. [p369]
- Cost-of-change as a decision input: before adopting a design, ask how much churn it would cause in the source. [p374]

  scope: core
  source: user-stated
  citation: 2026-08-14-1613-runvil-core-largest-part5.md [p380]
  rejected-alternative: overlay as a tool loaded separately from core
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: Prompts are written agnostic of the tool backend; the prompt says "search", never "search the web", and the tool's name and description are established by tool.need and can be rewritten when the tool is injected.
  scope: core
  source: user-stated
  citation: 2026-08-14-1613-runvil-core-largest-part5.md [p383], [p386]
  rejected-alternative: hardcoding the backend into prompt text and tool descriptions
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: Behavioral variation of a prompt comes from ahead-of-time configuration; the orchestrating model cannot reshape the Lua at runtime the way an agentic host reshapes instructions.
  scope: core
  source: user-stated
  citation: 2026-08-14-1613-runvil-core-largest-part5.md [p392]
  rejected-alternative: runtime reinterpretation of the pipeline by the model

  scope: global
  source: user-stated
  citation: 2026-08-14-1613-runvil-core-largest-part5.md [p393], [p395]
  rejected-alternative: none
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: Tool and Model are first-class Lua objects (tables) that can be inspected and invoked, which also makes them mockable in unit tests; the preamble can declare globals such as lists of tools usable in any section.
  scope: core
  source: user-stated
  citation: 2026-08-14-1613-runvil-core-largest-part5.md [p398], [p400], [p401]

  citation: 2026-08-14-1613-runvil-core-largest-part5.md [p427]
  rejected-alternative: passing prose as strings to model:infer()
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: A section is a sequence of alternating lua and prose blocks; non-final prose blocks are single-shot and always fall through, the final prose block runs the full tool loop until a reply with no tool call, and one conversation grows across all blocks of a section and is cleared between sections.
  scope: core

  citation: 2026-08-14-1613-runvil-core-largest-part5.md [p479]-[p487]
  rejected-alternative: none
  endorsement: affirmed

- statement: Sections are subroutines: execute("## Name") runs a section in a fresh VM and returns its reply, while jump("## Name") transfers control with a context-clearing, no-return goto; the default remains running sections in order.
  scope: core
  source: user-stated

  rejected-alternative: treating goto-with-return as a reusable function callable from many places
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: The control-transfer function is named jump() because goto is reserved in Lua, and the rename is swept across the entire repo as the first step of the work.
  scope: core
  source: user-stated
  citation: 2026-08-14-1613-runvil-core-largest-part5.md [p442], [p481]
  rejected-alternative: exposing sections through _G, or keeping the name goto()
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: The H1 preamble runs exactly once as a live preamble; per-section replay is abandoned because replay multiplies inference cost and corrupts state once the preamble can infer or write to the store.
  scope: core
  source: user-corrective
  citation: 2026-08-14-1613-runvil-core-largest-part5.md [p446], [p470]
  rejected-alternative: two-phase preamble treatment and shared-bytecode re-execution in section VMs
  endorsement: n/a

  citation: 2026-08-14-1613-runvil-core-largest-part5.md [p506]
  rejected-alternative: engine-provided default paths
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: All Lua is compiled at parse time so a successfully parsed Prompt is fully syntax-validated; there is one VM per whole section; the store is the only intentional mutable channel across sections, with functions, closures, globals, var, tools, and reply branch-local by construction; mutable run-global Lua is explicitly excluded.

  citation: 2026-08-14-1613-runvil-core-largest-part5.md [plans section: section-lua-lifecycle]
  rejected-alternative: none
  endorsement: corrected

- statement: Wire quirks (field synonyms, empty content, null-content tool calls) enter through one normalizer door so hosts stay dumb; a final turn with no tool calls and empty content is a hard error even when reasoning is present; reasoning_content is never promoted into the answer.
  scope: core

  rejected-alternative: adopting an external crate (genai, rig) instead of an in-core seam
  endorsement: unaddressed

- statement: Fanout fires all arms at once with the gateway queue as the throttle; replies stay ordered by arm index; fail-fast aborts sibling arms and propagates the first error; the store stays shared and mutex-safe, so authors must not assume arm N sees arm N-1 writes.

- [p384], [p388] Open question on tool-naming training bias (snake_case vs single word vs WebSearch); no directive reached.
- [p401] Temperament: "you always encapsulate, you always model" as general programming hygiene.
- [p412] Observation that the only point of the phase transition is to protect the epilog; analytical, not a directive.
- [p448]-[p451] Exploration of generic VM serialization and cloning (with an ID-table scheme for Rust userdata); abandoned in favor of "lua shared".
- [p500], [p501] Housekeeping preference: trim loose design/status files that create noise.
- [p508] Feature spec for a runvil-dev option to create a same-named directory next to a tool; implementation detail, not a behavior principle.

- Trust the frontier model's competence instead of enumerating hygiene basics: "I dont have to tell you what those are I hope, you are a frontier model." [p1]
- The quality bar for the result: code getting smaller, clearer, bounded API surface, crisp, understandable, without the smell of AI slop smearing and bloating everything. [p39], [p44]
- Vibe-coding for days without interim technical-debt refactors is why so many findings accumulated. [p30]
- Much time is wasted because correction subagents keep making mistakes. [p40]
- Autonomous-execution preference: run the plan without stopping for confirmation; on failure roll back and redo, so the user returns to a clean result. [p20]
- Reset, do not revert; force-pushing is fine on a solo repo. (Git mechanics, a technology choice.) [p15], [p19], [p20]

- The improvised review process was preferred over the pre-written refactor-rust tool: faster and more grounded in reality. [p49], [p50], [p51]
