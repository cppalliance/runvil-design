## Not converted

- "Should we do files or should we do state?" [p341] - an open musing on the state model, no directive landed.
- Line-offset table versus character ranges for edit tools [p343-p344] - a question about established practice, not a position.
- Sharded-mutex lock contention idea [p350-p351] - a performance implementation note the user explicitly deferred ("not something to worry about now").
- Sub-agent doing web search then web fetch into a virtual file [p355] - a usage scenario probing capability, not a directive.
- The web_fetch SSRF security surface (CIDR tables, redirect re-checks, size caps, content-type routing) [plans: webfetch crate extraction] - tool implementation spec, not language or engine behavior.
- Model tiering per section [plans: Orchestrator Design Document] - a convertible principle dropped only because the 20-candidate cap favored more general records.
- Lua sandbox contents (empty globals, safe stdlib only, instruction-count hook) [plans: Lua args substitution] - convertible but dropped at the cap; the module allowlist is also partly a technology choice.
- State tiering (files primary, counters for audit, store for the rest) [plans: Runvil Executor Tranche 1] - convertible but dropped at the cap.

  rejected-alternative: starting with an interpreted host language and bolting prompts onto it

- [p76] Naming preference: "args" over "params" for prompt parameters.
- [p84] Anxiety that twenty large per-tool schemas recreate the pydantic burden, just shifted into Lua.
- [p92], [p93] Open sandboxing worries: infinite loops in prompt Lua, and tools gaining file read/write through the Lua library.
- [p94] Belief that people will use prompt Lua for general-purpose computation, so static tool detection may never be complete.
- [p96], [p100] Open exploration of making the file the unit of state, tempered by the corrective that structured data like breadcrumbs still exists.
- [p123], [p129] Build-sequencing preference: one big plan implemented in subtractive tranches, starting from a hello-world executor invoked from the command line.
- [p130], [p131], [p132] Repo bookkeeping preferences: a cumulative status file and AGENTS.md at the root rather than .mdc rules.

## Not converted

- Model sovereignty: the standing temperament that every design decision should make mid-size open-weight models reliable at roughly 1/100th of frontier API cost (design document BLUF).
- "Minimize the amount of inference" as a general instinct behind several rulings [p67, p69].
- The transcript compaction algorithm (recursive halving, fidelity gradient, prompt reinjection, pre-compaction at 90%) - real directives, but scoped to Mentographist and explicitly declared not part of the orchestrator [p2, p15, p31, plans appendix].
- Chat-format preferences ("dont code fence me" [p12, p26], blockquote user text [p59]) - transcript formatting, not Runvil design.
- Open-weight hardware and latency discussion (model sizes, gaming cards, STT/TTS budget) [p4-p10, p38] - capability scouting, no behavioral directive.

## Not converted

- Skepticism about Gemma's reliability at tool calling ("that's its one fucking job") - a model-quality grievance, not a directive [p249], [p303].
- Staged definition of "beautiful" output (parity with local qwen, then surpass it, then three rounds of no improvement before switching subjects) - an experimentation methodology [p320].
- Optimize web-search agents for as few turns as possible - a tuning preference [p321].
- Do not bias a prompt toward a class of subject ("don't make the prompt biased to favor non-profits"; say "corporate filings") - a prompt-authoring neutrality preference [p325], [p326].
- A/B test thinking on/off across models and iterate until no axis improves; review code every 3 commits - a working style [p346], [p348].
- Commit uncommitted WIP before starting plan work - a workflow habit [p259], [p291].
- Preference for cribbing other people's code from the internet to make things work - an implementation attitude [p253].

## Not converted

- A prompt is a work of art; the single-prompt format is loved for its own sake. [p4]
- Design documents are provisional and lower priority than the conversation, always; conversation decisions override anything written in them. [p5], [p6], [plans section]
- Lua spawning sub-agents and blocking to collect their results into variables or a map was explored as a scenario, not decided. [p32]
- Dividing the problem space into synchronous and asynchronous halves is the way to make progress. [p36]
- Manual per-item fan-out markup that turns thirty lines into a hundred is not worth it; the ergonomics were left unresolved. [p46]
- Cuts to the design documents happen as they come up in conversation; no speculative purge. [plans section]

- statement: A tool always prints one line listing its functions and the active default before doing any work, defaulting to the lightest highest-dividend function, so the user can abort and escalate scope.

  citation: 2026-08-10-0856-repo-review-top-to-bottom.md [p45]
  rejected-alternative: none
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: A tool is self-contained: its rulebook is inlined at the bottom of the tool file in uniquely named XML-tagged blocks, and subagents are dispatched with a tiny prompt carrying only the tool path, the tag name, and the instruction to grep for the tag and execute the enclosed block.
  scope: global
  source: user-stated
  citation: 2026-08-10-0856-repo-review-top-to-bottom.md [p44]
  rejected-alternative: subagents reading external rulebook paths or receiving large inlined prompts
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: Completion is gated by an independent verification context; an implementing agent's self-report of "all green" is never trusted on its own.
  scope: global

  citation: 2026-08-10-0856-repo-review-top-to-bottom.md [plans section], [p24]
  rejected-alternative: accepting the fix agent's own green report as completion
  endorsement: affirmed

- statement: A run lands its result only when verification is green; on failure it rolls back with a reset (never a revert) and redoes the work.
  scope: global

  rejected-alternative: landing red, or undoing failure with a revert commit
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: When restarting from an earlier state, whatever is good in the discarded work is preserved, and the model (not the user) decides how much to roll back.
  scope: global
  source: user-stated
  citation: 2026-08-10-0856-repo-review-top-to-bottom.md [p19]
  rejected-alternative: asking the user how much to roll back, or discarding the work wholesale
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: A one-off cleanup effort is generalized into a reusable prompt that runs against recent changes as development proceeds, so debt is paid continuously instead of in one large effort at the end.
  scope: global
  source: user-stated
  citation: 2026-08-10-0856-repo-review-top-to-bottom.md [p31]
  rejected-alternative: repeating ad-hoc top-to-bottom reviews after debt accumulates
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: A review run actions only findings introduced by the commits under review; pre-existing debt in untouched code is grandfathered, so re-scanning an already-clean commit yields nothing and no watermark is needed.
  scope: global
  source: ai-proposed

  rejected-alternative: actioning all findings anywhere in the scanned code

## Not converted

- Flavor text must be genuine, lightly adapted Gibson fragments with every sentence reviewed for sense; nonsense imagery is called out by name. (aesthetic craft standard, [p54]-[p57])
- The finished result must be chefs-kiss; the recurring worry is whether the work is making the code cleaner or just bloating and smearing it around. (quality temperament, [p22], [p23], [p59])
- Wip commits pushed to the remote are a cheap backup and are kept. (pragmatism, [p26], [p27])
- The mess is self-diagnosed: vibe-coding for days without technical-debt refactors along the way is what produced the findings pileup. (philosophy of debt, [p30])
- When a run goes sideways, stop and interrogate the state before touching anything: is the top commit better than before, and how much would a reset lose. (temperament under failure, [p10]-[p12])
