## Not converted

- Small models carry a narrow vocabulary; vocabulary lives in pretraining, not in the fine-tune set. [p184]
- Before trusting the model's judgment, the user asks it to rate its own confidence. [p187]
- Early hypothesis that blur is near-lossless; measurement disproved it, a single pass drops or alters a specific in 43-54% of cases. [p199]
- The user interrogates every phrase of the rulebook; no wording survives unexamined. [p208], [p209], [p211], [p219]
- The endeavor keeps living out its own thesis: every tightening pass regenerates the disease it studies. [p220], [p221]
- A report about bloat that is itself bloated fails on contact. [plans section]

- Assembling the combined user guide should be a program that does one thing, not a prompt. (Excluded as a technology choice for repo tooling, not a language or engine behavior.) [p5]
- Stating a fact is not a request: the user stopped the agent for making unrequested changes after being told only that cppa uses Jekyll. [p23], [p24], [p25]
- Generated documentation belongs in the crate it documents, overriding default output routing. [p1], [p2]
- Git history should be kept clean: rewrite out a revert commit and the commit it reverts rather than layering corrections. [p29], [p30]

  rejected-alternative: building concurrency limits into the prompt executor

## Not converted

- The gateway executable may be as big as it needs to be; operational simplicity beats binary size [p16].
- The author works through an AI-driven workflow and feels layers of software between operator and machine; the design should collapse those layers [p16].
- Quantization quality bar: "Q4 sounds terrible" - skepticism toward heavy quantization for serious work [p4].
- GPU support must not be forced on anyone; a machine without CUDA still gets a working gateway [p46] - excluded as a build/technology choice, kept as a sensibility note.
- Build order preference: easiest and most useful first, hardest and most risky last [p38].
- Review process preference: exactly one round of review, edits made in the review context, because further rounds keep finding things forever [p45].
- Deadline temperament: "you will get it done in 2 hours" [p40].

- Open question, unresolved in this unit: should skipping a heading level be an error? [p145]
- Open question, unresolved in this unit: AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md? [p146]

- Hard-code the Anthropic base URL for now and point the HTTP layer at the gateway later. (Excluded as a technology/scaffolding choice, not a behavior.) [p149], [p169]

## Not converted

- A design document is mostly why; code contains what, and where nothing forces a choice, that fact is worth stating rather than papering over. [plans section]
- The bet behind rationale recovery: most design choices are forced by constraints that are themselves visible in the code, so the why is largely recoverable. [plans section]
- Contingency is unrecoverable from code; numbers chosen inside a range, facts learned outside the repository, and deleted alternatives leave no trace, so a high open count is honest archaeology, not failure of effort. [plans section]
- "What lost and why" is the most valuable line a design document has. [plans section]
- The user wants prompts to be first-class citizens in the harness and research output delivered into the chat, not into side boxes. [p24]

  rejected-alternative: treating tools and models as opaque registrations rather than encapsulated objects

  rejected-alternative: aborting the tool call on recoverable target failures
  endorsement: unaddressed

- statement: Prompts stay dialect-agnostic: the operator declares each model's tool dialect on the gateway, the gateway advertises it, core freezes it onto the bound model, and the tool loop selects the normalization plugin without ever asking the prompt what format to use; an unknown dialect id is a hard error with no silent fallback.

## Not converted

- [p376] After first-class tools arrive, the VM can no longer be assumed fixed once the preamble has run; it can change after each completion.
- [p395] Unshipped code earns no compatibility concessions: "there's no one to break."
- [p401] Encapsulation is plain programming hygiene; an abstraction earns its keep by being mockable and testable.
- [p411] Big changes get a deep, subagent-driven evaluation before adoption; thoroughness scales with blast radius.
- [p412] The phase transition's only real point is to protect the epilogue.
- [p432] The conversation is preeminent: design documents must be rewritten to match what was settled in discussion.
- [p436] Documentation teaches progressively: one new concept per section, no forward references, every example a complete runnable prompt.
- [p440] Front-page documentation is crisp, bottom-line-up-front, dense and scannable - it says what the thing is rather than performing cool.

- [p29] Whether {{ reply }} substitution injects information versus instructions is ambiguous and was raised as an open question, never resolved into a rule.
- [p30] Imperfect model output is acceptable because the user can always fix it.
- [p67] Tool call limits may be unnecessary at all; a large model concludes before overflow and a small model's context fills up and errors, which is a natural bound.

## Not converted

- Preserve the original design document (design-core-orig.md) byte-for-byte as the historical record. [p1]

- Review is read-only: the reviewer reports findings and never fixes or commits anything itself. A work-discipline rule for the review step, not a rule of the language or engine.
- Report back in under 80 words with the finding count and the most serious finding. A terse-reporting preference, bookkeeping.
- Write nothing for a check that passes. A signal-to-noise preference for review output, subsumed by the review discipline.
