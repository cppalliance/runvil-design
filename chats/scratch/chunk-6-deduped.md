  rejected-alternative: conditional compilation via feature gates
  endorsement: n/a

  rejected-alternative: routing all tool calls through the gateway

  source: ai-proposed
  citation: 2026-07-29-0937-brave-web-search-tools.md [plans section]

- "Hell no to shellout" [p15] - implementation preference (no shelling out to subprocesses), fails the altitude test.
- "I don't want a bunch of junk" [p21] - temperament about keeping dependencies lean; a preference, not a directive.
- "what is a Trait?" [p12] and "what is feature-gate?" [p16] - clarifying questions, no principle stated.

  source: user-stated
  citation: 2026-07-30-1046-compaction-algorithm-large-part3.md [p155], [p156], [p157], [p158]
  rejected-alternative: function-call notation such as call( "return", "x" )

  citation: 2026-07-30-1046-compaction-algorithm-large-part3.md [p163]
  rejected-alternative: injecting one tool per capability
  endorsement: n/a

  scope: core
  source: user-stated
  citation: 2026-07-30-1046-compaction-algorithm-large-part3.md [p164]
  rejected-alternative: offering the full call() surface to every section
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: A section that only ever jumps with clear offers a restricted goto() with no mode parameter, so the model does not have to pick a call kind.
  scope: core
  source: user-stated
  citation: 2026-07-30-1046-compaction-algorithm-large-part3.md [p222]
  rejected-alternative: offering the full multi-mode call() to a single-behavior section
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: The language provides both a dramatically simple single-concern call and a full swiss-army call, because decisions are what small models are worst at while frontier models handle multiple call kinds without trouble.

  rejected-alternative: a shared schema package used by both executor and gateway

## Not converted

- [p145] Open question, never resolved in this unit: should skipping a heading level be an error?
- [p189] Sequencing temperament: make a little progress on a lot of things instead of a lot of progress on a few; build the known-quantity skeleton (the gateway) first while control flow is still uncertain.
- [p158] Aesthetic conviction: there is something powerful about a small tool set plus prose with the model left to figure it out (partially converted into the tool-minimality and model-autonomy records above).

  scope: mcp

  citation: 2026-08-02-1419-mcp-client-continued.md [p39]
  rejected-alternative: naming each tool explicitly in the Lua for every section

  scope: mcp
  source: user-corrective
  citation: 2026-08-02-1419-mcp-client-continued.md [p58]
  rejected-alternative: need strings phrased like user prompts or utterances
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: Tool-need resolution runs locally and deterministically with no LLM in the resolution path; an LLM is at most an optional escalation, never the default matcher.
  scope: mcp
  source: user-stated
  citation: 2026-08-02-1419-mcp-client-continued.md [p27]
  rejected-alternative: an LLM as the primary matcher in the final system
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: A matching technique is adopted only after it proves itself on tests against real data; no matcher ships on intuition or on synthetic benchmarks alone.
  scope: mcp
  source: user-stated
  citation: 2026-08-02-1419-mcp-client-continued.md [p17]
  rejected-alternative: adopting a classifier without empirical validation

  scope: mcp
  source: user-corrective
  citation: 2026-08-02-1419-mcp-client-continued.md [p25]
  rejected-alternative: asking of each tool separately "is this a fit for the need"
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: When no single tool wins clearly, the resolver surfaces a shortlist of about three rather than forcing a top-1 guess, and a better-informed decider settles the near-tie.
  scope: mcp

  citation: 2026-08-02-1419-mcp-client-continued.md [p69]
  rejected-alternative: always returning a single best-guess tool

  citation: 2026-08-02-1419-mcp-client-continued.md [p61]
  rejected-alternative: silently picking among duplicate tools

  citation: 2026-08-02-1419-mcp-client-continued.md [p56]
  rejected-alternative: treating annotations as necessary for resolution
  endorsement: n/a

  scope: mcp
  source: user-corrective
  citation: 2026-08-02-1419-mcp-client-continued.md [p63]
  rejected-alternative: choose_mcp_tool as an automatic escalation path
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: choose_mcp_tool returns one or more tool descriptors, or a "no tools available" error, and it complements static launch-time binding rather than replacing it.
  scope: mcp
  source: user-stated
  citation: 2026-08-02-1419-mcp-client-continued.md [p66]
  rejected-alternative: none
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: On dynamic resolution the harness rewrites the context - the chosen descriptor placed before the prompt prose and the discovery exchange excised - so a dynamically discovered tool executes exactly as if it had been statically bound.
  scope: mcp
  source: user-stated
  citation: 2026-08-02-1419-mcp-client-continued.md [p67]
  rejected-alternative: appending the discovery results to the context like an ordinary tool result
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: Tool selection stays in the main context, which the author already governs (model choice, rewrite opt-out, full task history); the model that selects a tool is the model that will use it, so there is no chooser/executor capability mismatch and no orphan subcontext with its own unanswered model configuration.
  scope: mcp
  source: user-stated
  citation: 2026-08-02-1419-mcp-client-continued.md [p71], [design documents section]
  rejected-alternative: a fresh subcontext that retrieves and selects the tool, with a chooser context distinct from the executing model
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: For genuinely hard selection, a strong reasoning model can select the tool and pass the descriptor through a context-clearing goto into a fresh context where a cheaper model executes.
  scope: mcp
  source: user-stated
  citation: 2026-08-02-1419-mcp-client-continued.md [p72]

  citation: 2026-08-02-1419-mcp-client-continued.md [p79]
  rejected-alternative: none
  endorsement: n/a

## Not converted

- The author controls all the MCP servers, so hardening against hostile servers feels like wasted effort - a threat-model posture, not a directive. [p14]
- Accuracy is felt as a per-call error rate ("0.80 means one out of five tool calls will be wrong") - the stakes framing behind the abstention design. [p32]
- "Do everything asynchronously" - a working-style preference for the spike tooling, not the engine. [p46]
- Dataset-building craft: generate need strings with multiple models, and derive them by paraphrasing the descriptions of tools the author already intends to use. [p51] [p59] [p60]
- Inspect raw samples together before trusting a metric ("pick 30 descriptions at random... let's look at it together"). [p57]
- Process preferences: design doc first, then dataset, then reconcile the cited numbers; every design gets a companion rationale document mined from the chat history. [p75] [p82]
- A stream of clever matcher variants (vocabulary word-counts, noun/verb embedding channels, category routing with per-category models, dynamic LoRA pools) - all later measured and rejected; the temperament is propose freely, then let measurement kill. [p28] [p29] [p30] [p31] [p33]
- A trivial-reject pre-filter with no false rejections, pairing and categorizing tools to discard obvious mismatches fast - proposed, later rejected as hard category routing. [p55]
- Reconciliation rule from the plan: preliminary figures must be replaced by reproduced numbers, and any figure that moves enough to threaten a design choice gets flagged rather than silently patched. [plans section]

  scope: global
  source: user-corrective
  citation: 2026-08-02-1134-mcp-client-large-part5.md [p362]
  rejected-alternative: dispatch expressed as literal text the model interprets, e.g. task("### Researcher", "Find and save a source about {{ args }}")
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: An overarching design theme of the language is that it closely resembles the ordinary theory of computation; shared top-level reusable sections are subroutines, a staple of computation.
  scope: global

  citation: 2026-08-02-1134-mcp-client-large-part5.md [p385]
  rejected-alternative: none

  scope: core
  source: user-stated
  citation: 2026-08-02-1134-mcp-client-large-part5.md [p414], [p415]
  rejected-alternative: fall-through that appends each section into a growing shared context
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: A Runvil file requires YAML frontmatter carrying a runvil version number; major versions are incompatible changes, a file without the version is not a Runvil prompt and runs the traditional full-file way, and the engine offers a detection function rather than running plain prompts itself.
  scope: core
  source: user-stated
  citation: 2026-08-02-1134-mcp-client-large-part5.md [p402], [p403], [p407], [p427]
  rejected-alternative: a fallback mode for files without YAML, or the engine running plain prompts
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: A Runvil prompt is best thought of as a function - parameters in, string out, side effects possible - a linear pipeline that can have forks and fanouts, with a natural size limit on the program it can represent; deeper recursive structure is what separate files are for.
  scope: global
  source: user-stated
  citation: 2026-08-02-1134-mcp-client-large-part5.md [p410]
  rejected-alternative: perfect recursive section structure inside one file
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: A "---" line directly under an H2 heading protects that section from fall-through; the executor skips it and proceeds to the next section, and the mechanism survives the user cutting and pasting sections around.
  scope: core
  source: user-corrective
  citation: 2026-08-02-1134-mcp-client-large-part5.md [p382], [p383], [p387], [p388], [p389], [p390]
  rejected-alternative: a single "---" below which no execution occurs at all
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: Every subhead begins with a valid identifier as its first word, lowercase-normalized, and anything after it on the heading line is a comment; H2 names are unique across the file, H3 names are unique only within their enclosing H2, and H1 is not a subhead.
  scope: core

  citation: 2026-08-02-1134-mcp-client-large-part5.md [p369], [p371], [p372]
  rejected-alternative: restricting calls so sections may only call same-or-lower heading levels
  endorsement: n/a

  scope: boundary: markdown<->lua

  citation: 2026-08-02-1134-mcp-client-large-part5.md [p354]
  rejected-alternative: compulsory protections with no opt-out

  citation: 2026-08-02-1134-mcp-client-large-part5.md [p419], [p420]
  rejected-alternative: none
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: The MCP service is long-running rather than launched per invocation: it loads and syntax-checks its fixed set of prompts, loads libraries, and holds open-weight models in memory once, and it also hosts an MCP client because the prompts it runs make outbound MCP calls such as web search and web fetch.
  scope: mcp
  source: user-stated
  citation: 2026-08-02-1134-mcp-client-large-part5.md [p440]
  rejected-alternative: a stdio service the editor launches and tears down on every call
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: The MCP service exposes exactly two tools - enumerate the runnable prompts and run a prompt - because client context degrades when too many tools are installed; prompt-to-prompt calls inside a run never round-trip through MCP, and editor routing lives in a Cursor rule that sends files bearing runvil frontmatter to the service.
  scope: mcp
  source: user-stated

- "The markdown is the program, the model is the CPU, embedded Lua is the microcode, and the harness is the instruction decoder" - the defining metaphor of the whole design.
- Model sovereignty: every design decision (context clearing, flat tool calls, per-section scoping, fan-out to small models) is chosen to make mid-size open-weight models reliable.
- Integrity stance: subagent prompts are shipped verbatim from named sections rather than paraphrased by the model; what you test is what runs.
- Unit of testing equals unit of composition; each section is testable in isolation with known inputs.
- Honest-limits temperament on guard-wrapping untrusted tool output: a probabilistic mitigation, not a boundary; the hard controls are scoping and context-clearing isolation.
- Sequencing preference: structure the work as the shortest line to a working Cursor integration and push all later complexity much later.
- Lesson from Playbooks prior art: never put a compilation step between the prompt author and the model; the raw markdown is the program.
- Development ergonomics: the service picks up config and directory changes without a restart, and invoking an uninstalled prompt simply errors.

- [p41] Inclination toward a fine-tuned small open-weight model that computes a short description of a prompt; undecided whether to use it.
- [p43] Plans are executed as individual steps, each with its own commit plus code review and amended commit, never stopping to ask the user.
- [p20] Aversion to code paths that can theoretically fail but never actually do, because they produce code that appears to ignore errors.

- Less code to maintain beats bespoke machinery; prefer nil-ing out a table over building a dedicated error path. [p53] [p54]
- When a feature is removed, leave a short comment explaining why, written for a fresh-context reader. [p162]
- A Lua tool that combines deterministic data with a one-shot inference is the most powerful operation available: determinism plus model judgment. [p162]
- A silent no-op (tools.add between prose blocks) is taken as evidence of insufficient test coverage. [p145]
- The primitives should feel like one family: fanout is like infer. [p87]
- An itch for a general cleanup pass that finds stale, redundant, or tightened code across the codebase. [p134] [p158]
- Instinct against duplicating data: pass store paths rather than copying section strings. [p105] [p106]
