## Prompts



**[p224]** or maybe the large models have no trouble with multiple tools in the first place and we dont need the swiss army call.

**[p225]** the consolidated call assumed that small-model sections were going to need the possibility of choosing from many call kinds at once

**[p226]** show me all the ways to transfer

**[p227]** why can't the transfer be a real state channel?

**[p228]** here's the problem with not having the transfer. you end up making 2 tool calls instead of 1 to propagate state

**[p229]** you misunderstand. I'm imagining a direct context injection:
goto( "## Research", "Search the web for {{ args.name }}" )

**[p230]** its nice because its simple.
1. copy the string into a new context
2. execute the lua for that context
3. run the prompt for that context

**[p231]** yes it has to resolve at the call site, that's the whole point. this is the "poor man's argument list." Or another way to look at it "the lazy engineer's function parameters." The best engineers are lazy. This is the best kind of feature because it gives us everything with the minimal implementaiton

**[p232]** the hell with design-runvil.md it is overengineered.

**[p233]** we can refer to the design doc to mine it for ideas but its bloatslop

**[p234]** why can't we use return in Lua? because were in a chunk not a function?

**[p235]** I'm not asking for it to be an identifier.. just use Lua return the way it was intended. to return.

**[p236]** nice try but.. I think what you are saying is goto will return the toolcall JSON? but we didn't declare the tool in tools.add

**[p237]** what is "a descriptor" ?

**[p238]** so the rust code checks the lua stack, finds a table, digs into the keys, etc?

**[p239]** what's this macroshit in the square brackets

**[p240]** Tell me the entire current thinking on control flow.

**[p241]** something not right calling fanout() in check() because what do you do with the data when it comes back?

**[p242]** "return goto("## Research", "Search the web for {{ args.name }}")" this can't be a reusable function called from more than one place, because control always transfers to the same place after the REsearch is done.

**[p243]** its not clear to me how the store works

**[p244]** Okay, i think we should make a new plan. And we're gonna do the, we're gonna add the Lua, and we're gonna add just at the minimum, we don't need the store. Just actually, wait. I don't, I'm not sure about this. I don't understand! Go to Are we giving the tools go to, are we giving the prompt go to or not? What operations, what, show me the tools that the prompt gets on the lo on the prompt surface.

**[p245]** how do we handle a fork and then later rendezvous

**[p246]** A -> B -> F -> G
     \                    \ H
       C -> D -> E/

**[p247]** A spawns both B and C which each continue on a 2-node extension then they rendezvous at H. The key is that H has to wait until both sides of the fork rendezvous since its data-dependent

**[p248]** This sounds good, but what's virtual files? What does that allow? And then how do we return a value?

**[p249]** Lua can write of course. It can dedup an array of strings. It can sort. It can replace em-dash with dash. Many things.

**[p250]** this is too much. we dont even have Lua yet. Lets just add Lua, and implement args. And substitution. So we can have a tool that just returns {{ args[0] }} or whatever

**[p251]** I would argue that the first args should just be one string. Lets look at Briefer. You had args.name, args.mission or something, having to do with the organization. But that requires the caller to do inference on search. Instead, it should just take one string. And the first step of the prompt is to run deduce the values of name and mission and store them

**[p252]** walk me through what staker calcultes before going to the web @tools-public/tools/staker.md

**[p253]** Let me ask you a question: when, when staker. Figures out like date, slug, identity. Where does it store that? Where does an orchestrator store that? How does the model store it? Does it go in a thinking block? Does it just put it in the chat and refer to it using a tension like it just goes in the history? How does that work?

**[p254]** what if state.vars is a block of key/value pairs and we inject that into the context on every goto:
<system_prompt>
{{ state.vars }}
</system_prompt>

**[p255]** we are just exploring the idea for now. state.vars can be a different name. and what if we put them at the end of the context

**[p256]** I was using {{ state.vars }} just as notation. in practice the Lua would control it, and the executor would choose the tag

**[p257]** now I was thinking context engineering on multiturn horizons. on a tool call, remove the facts bag from the transcript, then inject the tool results, then add the facts bag back

**[p258]** on a 3B model, it matters. prefix caching is irrelevant at 3B

**[p259]** at 3B you probably have a tiny context window

**[p260]** we can always just put a flag on the bag for floating

**[p261]** spawn async subagent and update the @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\plans\runvil_orchestrator_only.plan.md plan here with everything new. and lets keep designing

**[p262]** how does mapreduce work

**[p263]** Okay, I'm not clear what we're doing. So we're doing the args, and we get a string, and now we wanna decompose it into two values, name and Category. And then that's inference, and now we wanna pass those two numbers into the next step. So what does that look like?

**[p264]** where does set_identity come from

**[p265]** That's two tool calls. We should have instead
```
set( "Acme Corp", "fintech", "acme-corp" )

**[p266]** spawn a subagent search the web around this pattern report back

**[p267]** do we inject the tools at the end too?

**[p268]** you miss my point. I'm saying that when you jump to a different section, the tools changing at the front could invalidate the kv

**[p269]** maybe nested subsections should share the parent prefix context recurisvely

**[p270]** The context for every heading will look like this:
<prefix>
<body>
<suffix>

**[p271]** The suffix floats. The body is throwaway. The prefix is inherited by child headings cumulatively

**[p272]** you dont have to cap shit, the prompt author does it naturally. for example lets say we want to analyze a paragraph through several subagents. You do this:

**[p273]** ## Level 2
<data>
{{ var.paragraph }}
</data>
### 1
Apply test 1 to data
### 2
Apply test 2 to data
...

**[p274]** to be clear, there's no fanout here

**[p275]** I'm not sure about this. IT seems this is just shorthand for putting a variable at the beginnin {{ var.prefix }}

**[p276]** lets structure the args plan to implement "echo" first? it takes 1 arg and just returns it. that's the first commit. and then defer the rest in the plan

**[p277]** we still need Lua or how else will we return the value?

**[p278]** arg without Lua is too little

**[p279]** remove everything already implemented, from these plans @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\plans\lua_args_substitution_278b888c.plan.md @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\plans\runvil_orchestrator_only.plan.md leave the rest

**[p280]** yeah I want the master plan to be unbuilt design. the design reference is the Rust code + what is unbuilt.

**[p281]** what do we do next

**[p282]** I don't understand "var"

**[p283]** var.date, var.time, var.uuid

**[p284]** so the next step is {{ }} substitution? instead of facts can we have const.date, const.time, i.e. constants? I want the timestamp when the prompt started to be a constant. but i also maybe want const.now which is the current time. and every context should have a unique id. it can start from 1. this way if they need to compute a unique filename for the vfs they can do it

**[p285]** how about sys.date, sys.now, etc

**[p286]** sys.when is the time when the prompt was launched
sys.now is the current time

**[p287]** yeah that's all fine but we have to figure something out, on a multi-turn context does the {{ sys.now }} update each turn? How will the model detect time passing in this case

**[p288]** No I dont want to start accumuluating permanent crap in the context

**[p289]** can substitution do formulas {{ var.a + var.b }} ?

**[p290]** I don't want to pull by the model. I want the Lua to be able to say "this model needs the current time" and have things magically work.

**[p291]** well that can wait. show me what the next increment of work is

**[p292]** make sure each commit has tests and gets code reviewed and has docs and user docs. run the plan.

**[p293]** do fall through now and just fall through since thats one testable thing

**[p294]** do fall through now and just fall through since thats one testable thing

**[p295]** Where should you put a note about handling the 400s later / retry ?

**[p296]** sure commit the whole repo

**[p297]** Let me ask you a question. Should I create like a vibe coding addendum, like a prompt, and then when you load it up, like it, it, it updates the plan with some sensible things, like the way that I like to work, like small commits, do the testing. Is, is there any value there?

**[p298]** hell no, I dont want mdc. I was thinking something more like @tools-public/how-to/how-to-vibe-code.md but way more lightweight (like, 20% of that )

**[p299]** hmm no, my experience does not agree with you. I regularly load @tools-public/how-to/how-to-write-prompts.md into plans and its like a miracle.

**[p300]** dont think too hard about it I know what to do. I was just wanting to get a second opinion before I took a detour.

**[p301]** how-to-vibe-code is stupidly overengineered.

**[p302]** Yes exactly. 1/5th of what it is, cleaned up (and not using this stupid word "grain") and I can inject it into the context periodically to keep things fresh

**[p303]** I'm not asking you to do it

**[p304]** run @tools-public/tools/chatlight.md but only include the operator's chat. nothing else

**[p305]** Okay, what's next? Should we implement web search in the Are we putting this in core?

**[p306]** sorry I have no idea what you are talking about what is SSRF URL policy

**[p307]** how does @wg21-paperflow/packages/assay @wg21-paperflow/packages/pipeline handle it

**[p308]** sure but we know it doesn't. how hard is it to implement a CIDR blocklist? and the protected DNS ?

**[p309]** I want webfetch in its own crate. an d I want to move design-search into the crate directory as design-webfetch.md.

**[p310]** it is silly for the design docs to have rust types and declarations. the model can just create those on demand. As the plan proceeds to imnplement, I want the corresponding rust types and code REMOVED from the design doc so that what is left, is just the decisions. the rationale. the why.

**[p311]** I'll deal with the other design documents later. I want this strictly webfetch and I want it comprehensive. apply @tools-public/how-to/how-to-vibe.md

**[p312]** I prefer each commit to make progress on its own, not to have 4 commits that then require a 5th commit to retroactively realize the progress of the preevious 4 (if I understand you correctluy)

**[p313]** run @tools-public/tools/architect.md and we are using this existing plan @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\plans\webfetch_crate_extraction_cf3b8853.plan.md

**[p314]** Review the plan. Is anything missing? Do we have enough to build our super duper web fetch?

**[p315]** sorry what is this? what is "raw" ?

**[p316]** I see no downside to implementing all features and letting the caller decide, with sensible default.

**[p317]** to be clear, runing the plan will both produce the design document and also build it?

**[p318]** Ohh there is a misunderstanding. I want @tools-public/tools/architect.md to generate design-webfetch.md when the PLAN runs

**[p319]** fix @tools-public/tools/architect.md right now, "Run" means running the plan and the architect puts the instructions to build the design doc into the plan in a way that gets triggered when the plan runs, and the design document is created after the implementation is done so that the design document is in sync.

**[p320]** run @tools-public/how-to/how-to-write-rust.md

**[p321]** So now we have, what do we have? The web fetch? I see WebFetch gateway core CLI, is that right?

**[p322]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\plans\lua_args_substitution_278b888c.plan.md review the plan run @tools-public/tools/architect.md

**[p323]** its done?

**[p324]** Okay, let's create a new plan. And we're going to do a multi-turn web search and fetch, and the argument is gonna be, you know, some information like, "Tell me about a particular person. " And then the prompt is gonna do some searching, it's gonna gather some information, and once it has like five or six hundred tokens, it's gonna stop, and then it's gonna return that string.

**[p325]** apply @tools-public/how-to/how-to-vibe.md

**[p326]** apply @tools-public/how-to/how-to-write-rust.md

**[p327]** lol no I just wanted to see it work lets not get hung up on the token counts

**[p328]** I don't understand, where's the Lua? It says all the tools come from the what? So if there's no Lua, then you just default to all the tools?

**[p329]** Can we add the tool like for the, I mean, that's important because if there's 20 tools in the front matter, we're gonna be injecting 20 tools. We need to implement that. Okay, let's get that, let's get that done.
