*Prompts p327-p375 of 511. Part 4 of 5. The Plans and Design Documents sections are in part 5.*



## Prompts



**[p327]** seems sstuck?

**[p328]** its done?

**[p329]** what did we learn

**[p330]** how tf can llama-server die? spawn subagents search the web

**[p331]** should we try Gemma again

**[p332]** do you want to try fixing the llama crash

**[p333]** Supervise local llama-server after death

**[p334]** Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself.

**[p335]** To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos.

**[p341]** did you commit?

**[p342]** Yes, obviously

**[p343]** okay lets try the qwen 27B?

**[p344]** rename qwen.toml to qwen9.toml

**[p345]** could thinking help us

**[p346]** well, we are on the way to parallel locked to 2 or 1 so, if we go down to 1 we might as well do A/B test of thinking on and off. We might discover that thinking transforms the output and makes it beautiful. You should test it again with Qwen 9. And Qwen 27. I want you to do that same long-running experiment where you adjust things until there are no more improvemnets. Use the same subjects:
1. "The C++ Alliance"
2. "Boost C++ Library Collection"
3. "Bloomberg"

**[p347]** after all that then try gemma.

**[p348]** I want you to run the plan and DO NOT STOP until you cannot make any progress on any axis reliably. Or if you get an unrecoverable error. Keep the code clean, do a review every 3 commits and fix one round

**[p349]** whats the conclusion

**[p350]** what does "upstream 422" mean

**[p351]** so Qwen doesn't really fit in my VRAM then?

**[p352]** could we make the slot bigger for 27B?

**[p353]** what is n_predict

**[p354]** could fine tuning help

**[p355]** are there other models to try

**[p356]** okay. try Mistral.

**[p357]** okay. try Mistral.

**[p358]** take down the gateway, delete the cached mistral,

**[p359]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\plans\gateway_web_search_upgrade_59d2ae56.plan.md add to the plan: after the search upgrade, lets try qwen 3.6 at Q4/Q5. parallel=1, context at least 64kb

**[p360]** what does "unsloth" mean

**[p361]** what do you mean "no thicken" ?

**[p362]** git add commit

**[p363]** run @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\plans\gateway_web_search_upgrade_59d2ae56.plan.md

**[p364]** seems to be stuck

**[p365]** how long did the qwen 27B run take

**[p366]** 3-4 min ain't bad

**[p367]** Hey, listen up, here's the deal: we have to work on the store. We need to be able to read actual files, but we also wanna have the virtual files, and they both need to be available at the same time, but the current model doesn't support that. So my question is, what do we do?

**[p368]** Oh, here's what I think happened. This is what I think happened. I think... In our effort to protect The machine From the prompt, we confused two things. One is the tool that lets you access files, right? Like read file, write file, replace, append, those are the tools, those are exposed to the LLM. Then you have the Lua API, and the problem is we confused the two. We assumed that, that the Lua should be sandboxed and that the Lua shouldn't be allowed to write files. That doesn't make sense. We need the Lua to be able to read and write actual files and read and write the memory files. And then For the prompt, there we need to tightly control it, like we need to every Every H2 section, when we inject the tools, we should inject what files it can have access to. We, we should inject the file system and what the memory files are or something. Like, there's, there's something here, we need to figure this out.

**[p369]** I wanna talk about this. We're not, you were very quick to edit the plan and we're not talking about it. Review the plan and then give me a good discussion. Explain the idea, give me the pros and cons, get it from the angles. I'm gonna show you some of my structured prompts and then you tell me how they play out. @tools-public/tools/briefer.md @tools-public/tools/diligence.md @tools-public/tools/staker.md

**[p370]** Oh, I'm thinking like, what if I wanna do like a tool that does coding? Like, what if I want a tool that refactors a source file? In that case, you need to be able to have like multi-turn access.

**[p371]** a general principle is: no parallel mechanisms. a single, small, well-designed set of primitives services all the needs. the tool scoping mechanism exists so we should lean on it as much as possible.

**[p372]** I think so but we have another design wrinkle. go back to web search. during testing, a model chose web_fetch before doing web_search, on its first turn. what if we had a way to express in the H2 (or H3): only web_search is available in the first turn, and then web_fetch and web_search are available from turns onwards? this locks the model to calling just one tool

**[p373]** One of my ideas is to be able to have a Lua function as a tool. Right? Because, like, for example, there's gonna be cases where we want the model to, like, set some data, but we don't wanna have to write a Rust function just for setting a variable. Right? We wanna be able to just inline the code. So you can set a function, a Lua function as a tool, and it can mirror an existing tool, but it can be like a front end. And so we can make a search tool out of Lua, which is a front end to the real search tool, and then we make it so that when the tool is called, that it does a tools dot add for fetch.

**[p374]** My thinking is that the user is opting in to the behavior, so that makes it ok. My question is, have a look at the source code. How much churn would it actually cause?

**[p375]** what does "require Closed" mean?
