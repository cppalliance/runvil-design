## Prompts



**[p156]** do we already have a config object?

**[p157]** for now lets just set 200 max in @runvil/briefer.md YAML and I will run it again.

**[p158]** commit the gitignore change

**[p159]** here how do I inject "reply" into the context but treat it as untrusted input @runvil/briefer.md:57-58

**[p160]** is var persisted between H2s?

**[p161]** this is a problem. in this particular case `reply` is definitely untrusted. it is the joining of web fetches

**[p162]** here's my problem, if `store` is an actual file system then we would get evidence.md as a useless file

**[p163]** would this be the first time that the lua injects context?

**[p164]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\92.txt:1010-1012 it should show the line number

**[p165]** @runvil/briefer.store/.trace it should be deleting all the trace files on launch

**[p166]** yes make that change. leave the files alone for now

**[p167]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\92.txt:298-301 wtf happened??

**[p168]** but it worked in the previous run, what changed?

**[p169]** no thnat's not correct. we just produced @cabinet/_scratch/research.md in the previous run

**[p170]** I feel like maybe we need to bake the limit into the tools.add call

**[p171]** The question is what do we do when this budget is exhausted

**[p172]** oh... the tools are passed in a sidechannel to the gateway, and injected at the beginnin?

**[p173]** and what if "all the fetched content" is a bunch of 404s?

**[p174]** aborting the whole run is preferable. a hallucinated evidence packet taints the entire downstream result. see @tools-public/tools/briefer.md

**[p175]** it sounds like max_turns is not really on the tools its on the subagent itself so we would want something like config.max_turns(8) ?

**[p176]** this means we take ALL the tools away on exhaustion

**[p177]** is "converge" a term of art

**[p178]** look at the trace again and explain what actually happened @runvil/briefer.store/.trace

**[p179]** what about adding some temperature?

**[p180]** so the search did not actually 404?

**[p181]** @runvil/briefer.store much better

**[p182]** I phrased it this way:

**[p183]** > Search the web up to 3 times...

**[p184]** it doesn't feel like all 10 arms are launched concurrently though

**[p185]** how many can llama serve

**[p186]** How long, just a quick rough estimate dont get all precise on me, would it take to load a 1T parameter model on a blackwell B300 rack

**[p187]** would the gateway handle 10 concurrent web search?

**[p188]** why is the prompts output @cabinet/_scratch/research.md so thin compared to @cabinet/_scratch/2026-08-08-briefer-cpp-alliance/2026-08-08-briefer-cpp-alliance-evidence.md

**[p189]** @runvil/briefer.store/evidence.md but it got a lot of data

**[p190]** this is a problem, how do I close the gap with this model?

**[p191]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\92.txt:432-435 did I not compile?

**[p192]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\92.txt:1004-1007 fail

**[p193]** Away, I don't wanna match the tool description verbatim. This thing has to work. We have a whole crate that's dedicated to semantic matching, and you're telling me that it's not gonna work? No, no, no, no, no. We gotta figure this out!

**[p194]** yes 3

**[p195]** just do it in a single commit with one review pass

**[p196]** Understand, the test is starting a Promphor gate way, but I already have it running. Does that mean I'm myself? But wait, that's huh? Okay, what if it's already running?

**[p197]** its stuck

**[p198]** Oh right, it has to redownload. Did we get rid of the test Qwen?

**[p199]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\92.txt:1004-1008 fail

**[p200]** its been renamed to RUNVIL_GATEWAY_KEY

**[p201]** I think this is all wrong. the test should not be lanching the gateway. it should require the gateway already exists, and that the gateway already has the configuration it needs. the gateway, the test, and runvil-core crates are all in the same repo what do you think?

**[p202]** Yes I like having the 0.6B model on hand without the gateway. Its a simple setup, and it allows for integration tests where inference actually takes place, which expands our potential testing surface without the bulk of spawning the gateway. What do you think?

**[p203]** yes. question: should this program which puts a prompt in "dev mode" be its own crate?

**[p204]** that sounds quite good actually. Yes I want a beautiful refactoring and to simplify the test crate. I want the dev crate to have nice documentation for the user. its own README.md in the crate root, design.md to explain the design choices. the readme should have full, friendly instructions.

**[p205]** Okay, but wait a minute. Context_max_tokens and no_think, those should be properties of the prompt, not the command line. Why are we putting that in the command line? The prompt has to specify what the minimum context size is. Like, that's how it's supposed to work. Model dot need.

**[p206]** Okay, but wait a minute. Context_max_tokens and no_think, those should be properties of the prompt, not the command line. Why are we putting that in the command line? The prompt has to specify what the minimum context size is. Like, that's how it's supposed to work. Model dot need.

**[p207]** update @runvil/briefer.md for me too, and make it put the date and model on its own paragraph at the bottom of the report, in italics

**[p208]** review the plan, apply @tools-public/rulebooks/rust-rulebook.md as needded, and incorporate @tools-public/rulebooks/vibe-rulebook.md

**[p209]** where is the word grain coming from

**[p210]** run @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\plans\extract_runvil-dev_crate_87789848.plan.md

**[p211]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\4.txt:445-449 this has been running for a while

**[p212]** it finished but it says
2026-08-08T21:14:31.7825435Z - claude-sonnet-4-6
why ?

**[p213]** Why Sonnet? I thought we got rid of that.

**[p214]** create a new configuration C:\Users\Vinnie\cursor\local.toml with the bigger model

**[p215]** I thought we had the idea for gemma or smething. a 31b moe or 27b dense at fp4?

**[p216]** that's it. gemma-27b

**[p217]** what does license-gated mean

**[p218]** how do I set the hugging face token

**[p219]** I cleared it with Google use the official version

**[p220]** dont pressure me to run the plan. I want a hierarchy of files:

**[p221]** common.toml 
gemma.toml
qwen.toml

**[p222]** common.toml is inherited

**[p223]** the plan should clean up all the cache files if they are stale. same for the repo

**[p224]** what is this  crates/runvil-gateway/src/local/artifacts.rs

**[p225]** well is it committed?

**[p226]** yes obviously

**[p227]** where is gemma.toml

**[p228]** That's the wrong place. it was supposed to be C:\Users\Vinnie\src\cursor\gemma.toml. move all 3 files there now.

**[p229]** how do I know when the download is done

**[p230]** what does it mean to "provision" ?

**[p231]** still 0kb

**[p232]** why is it so slow

**[p233]** loading a 70gb model will be terrrible. can we show graphical progress maybe a bar and a spinner and a percentage?

**[p234]** lets do it

**[p235]** Gateway download progress bar

**[p236]** Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself.

**[p237]** To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos.

**[p238]** Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself.

**[p239]** To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos.

**[p240]** should we do the HTTP get in chunks of 1MB?

**[p241]** how do I run the dev

**[p242]** wow @runvil/briefer.store/report.md is filled with hallucinations and incorrect information

**[p243]** the smaller model performed better

**[p244]** Okay, here's what I don't understand. It's a twenty-seven billion parameter model. How can they put out a model that hallucinates like this? What fucking good is it? What's the use of the model if it can't be trusted? I don't understand. I must be using it wrong.

**[p245]** where did the hallucination happen? check the evidence packet @runvil/briefer.store/evidence.md

**[p246]** can you submit a turn to the Gemma instance running in the gateway?

**[p247]** play with it and figure out how to make it tell the truth when assembling @runvil/briefer.store/evidence.md

**[p248]** play with it and figure out how to make it tell the truth when assembling @runvil/briefer.store/evidence.md
