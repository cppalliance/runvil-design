## Prompts



**[p1]** @runvil/runvil.md

**[p2]** runvil run papergate

**[p3]** @cabinet/_research/2026-08-15-p4210r0-copy-on-write.md

**[p4]** @mcp.json (2-9)

**[p5]** Okay, first of all, make sure everything's stopped. This is a pain in the ass, like, this is way too much bullshit. We gotta figure this out. So, first of all, let me debug the gateway. Forget the MCP server for now. Can you use curl? And can you test the gateway? Like, can you, like, sniff it out, see what the fuck's going on? Show me all the possible gateway URLs and all the operate I wanna show, show me what the gateway can do so I can get an idea of how to test it, and then you start testing it yourself.

**[p6]** try it

**[p7]** gateway.env has:
RUNVIL_GATEWAY_API_KEY=dev-secret

**[p8]** I only told you to debug the gateway

**[p9]** is your mistakes because Opus 4.6 Medium? would more thinking help? Or should I switch to a newer model like 4.8, or Fable 5?

**[p10]** okay but how do I make you just listen to me from the start? you obviously are not following commands so how would more commands fix that?

**[p11]** What about Fable 5

**[p12]** I'm fucking asking you question!

**[p13]** Hey God, Fable 5 is The latest model from Anthropic, it's like, you know how Anthropic has Opus, Sonnet, well now they have Opus and Fable, and it's version five. You're 4.6, there's Opus 4.8, there's Opus 5, and there's Fable 5.

**[p14]** Yeah, you're right. Let me ask you more, let me be more precise. So every time I hear, I've been having a lot of success with Opus four point six, but, and, but this is the first time that I've done work with like command lines and shit, and I'm this is the first time I've ever seen the model fuck up like this. Like, usually it does a great job. Like, I give it instructions and you follow, but like now you're not following, and I mean, the model hasn't changed, so it must be the domain. So I follow the AI news and I keep hearing about, oh, Qwen three point six, Qwen three point seven, and they say that it's good at long horizon tasks, and it's and then you see those benchmarks and it's got those percentages. Is that, is this what they're referring to? That the model actually listens? So models, I think, aren't they supposed to get better? Like every new version, it listens to you more. So this could just be a problem of Opus four point six, I'm asking. Does this make sense? Do you know?

**[p15]** Run the, run the gateway, and I wanna see the whole battery of tests.

**[p16]** what is "admin status" and "admin profiles" ?

**[p17]** now bring up the mcp server

**[p18]** runvil run papergate @cabinet/_research/2026-08-15-p4210r0-copy-on-write.md

**[p19]** runvil run papergate @cabinet/_research/2026-08-15-p4210r0-copy-on-write.md

**[p20]** does the prompt work now

**[p21]** what do you mean the watcher wont pick this up

**[p22]** Fuck this! No! No, no, no, this has to be fucking fixed! What's this whizzle? I fucking hate the whizzle! Spawn some agents and search the web for a fucking solution to this shit!

**[p23]** on Windows I dont want polling I want a native directory watcher that works through IOCP

**[p24]** how do I avoid WSL completely

**[p25]** why does Git Bash route through wsl?

**[p26]** Git Bash does not actually route through WSL; they are two completely separate, independent terminal environments.If your system is routing terminal commands through WSL when you intend to use Git Bash, it is happening because an IDE, script, or the Windows operating system is accidentally executing WSL's bash.exe instead of Git for Windows' bash.exe.Why This Confusion HappensIdentical Executable Names: Both environments use an executable named bash.exe.The Windows PATH Conflict: When WSL is installed, Windows automatically adds a shortcut to WSL's bash environment at C:\Windows\System32\bash.exe. Because System32 is usually positioned near the top of your system's PATH variable, any generic command calling for bash will trigger WSL instead of Git Bash.IDE Misconfigurations: Development applications like VS Code, Cursor, or Git Extensions often auto-detect a shell by searching for "bash". They mistakenly bind to the first bash.exe they find in your system path, which is usually WSL.How to Fix ItYou can resolve this issue by forcing your system or editor to target the explicit path for Git Bash, or by adjusting your environment variables.1. Point Directly to the Git Bash ExecutableStop calling generic bash commands. Update your shortcuts, scripts, or IDE terminal settings to use the absolute path for Git Bash:Standard path: C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe(Note: Avoid using git-bash.exe for integrated IDE terminals, as it spawns a separate window instead of embedding nicely).2. Reorder Your System Environment VariablesIf a third-party script relies on a global bash call, you must move Git Bash ahead of WSL in your system variables:Press Win + R, type sysdm.cpl, and hit Enter.Navigate to the Advanced tab and click Environment Variables.Under System variables, select Path and click Edit.Move C:\Program Files\Git\bin\ and C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\ to the very top of the list, above C:\Windows\System32.Click OK and restart your computer or IDE to apply changes.3. Fix Your VS Code / IDE Default ProfileIf this is happening strictly inside an integrated code editor terminal, explicitly define the path in your settings.json file:json"terminal.integrated.profiles.windows": {
    "Git Bash": {
        "path": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe",
        "icon": "terminal-bash"
    }
},
"terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows": "Git Bash"
Use code with caution.If you are still seeing WSL paths, let me know:Where is this routing behavior happening? (e.g., VS Code terminal, Windows Terminal, or standard command prompt?)What does the command where bash output when run inside your terminal?I can provide exact settings or commands based on your tools.

**[p27]** I exited, reordered the paths, and relaunched. check now

**[p28]** runvil run papergate @cabinet/_research/2026-08-15-p4210r0-copy-on-write.md

**[p29]** the mcp server is supposed to return the contents of the output file so it can be displayed in the chat when an output file is not specified

**[p30]** it is supposed to appear in the chat

**[p31]** there's a double output. it shows the chat reply and then shows the "contents" of report.md

**[p32]** who wrote "--- output: report.md ---" ? where is that code

**[p33]** Why can't I click to open that

**[p34]** I mean runner.rs

**[p35]** the 2nd one worked

**[p36]** the newline isn't quite working

**[p37]** it was in the mcp call box

**[p38]** but why, this is unintuitive that you need an extra newline. newlines are supposed to work.

**[p39]** I feel like If there's a If the pr if the runvil prompt only has one output file. And the invocation doesn't map it to a real file, then that should be the only output. We shouldn't, shouldn't say, we shouldn't put the three dashes, we shouldn't put the name of it, of the file, we should just only, just have the contents.

**[p40]** runvil run papergate @cabinet/_research/2026-08-15-p4210r0-copy-on-write.md

**[p41]** runvil run papergate @cabinet/_research/2026-08-15-p4210r0-copy-on-write.md

**[p42]** what model is it using

**[p43]** Question Now I have the sections. How do I fan out? I wanna fan out, I want each fan leg to have its own section, but I don't have these items in a list. How do I inject it? Do I use Lua and like extract each line? Do I use like a pattern match and like put together like an array, like what do I do?

**[p44]** And we're gonna need to update this thing. We need a new feature. So I think, I think Fanout. This just doesn't right. Show me what the fanout API looks like right now.

**[p45]** Let's explore. I, I think this needs to change. I think what is the most fundamental operation of FanOut? I would say that it is It's executing a set of operations in parallel. And that's it. So, but what's an operation? An operation has to be a section. Because we're gonna, it needs tools, so it needs to have a Lua opener, and then it probably wants to do inference, of course, or else we would have just executed Lua to begin with. We don't need, we don't need the parallelism if it's only Lua. So, in other words, it, it has to be a section. We need a section. But then. Yeah, I think we need, it has to be a section. It has to be a section, okay. And then To get the parallelism. We have to inject. Something in there. Make it different. And that's the item. And That's what the second parameter is for. We have a section that has a list. And that gives us the different items. But In lua, we need a better way to do this. We have to allow that second parameter to be. An array. And then, in order to restore the functionality that we're gonna lose, then we need like a function that takes the section name. As a parameter, and it returns an array which is the bullet, which is the numbered list that's in that section. What do you think about that?

**[p46]** what do you mean "installed" ?

**[p47]** Question for you, what's this open tool scope? Like the code talks about the tool scope being open, closed, and all that, and like now that we allow for multiple sections, that aren't we just holding the tool scope open the whole time? Is this just don't tell me this is just for the epilogue. That would be a big waste of having all that code just to keep just so that we could close it right before the end?

**[p48]** I'm confused, you say the set can't change mid-conversation, but we're running prose, how could the set change anyway? The set can only change from Lua. So Closing the tool scope doesn't make any sense.

**[p49]** Seems like a lot of tryhard. To protect against such a trivial case, how much code is involved in the scope opening and closing? Like if we were to remove it, how much would we clean up?

**[p50]** You mean the tool schema sent to the model would silently not match? That's not true. What would it not match?

**[p51]** Instead of We have to move the code that That sends the schema. Do we have to when we, when we compute the schema to send to the model, we just have to move that out of closed scopes, we'll just put it in a function, calculate tools, and then we call that, and then that's what we pass to the model.

**[p52]** Wait a minute. Can we do something like, can we just replace the add function in the tool table? As a, if we want the error, like we don't have to do all this close scopes business, we can just replace, we can, if, if we know that we're in the last Lua block, then we just zap out the, the members of the tool struct that would be destructive.

**[p53]** It sounds to me. Like. Well, first of all, I like the error. I prefer an error over nil. I think. Would nil also generate an error?

**[p54]** No, no, no. It's No, no, no, we're better off with nil because there's less code. The less code we have to maintain, the better. The user still gets the file and line number, and then it'll, it'll, that's enough to know. Like when they see that that file, when they see that there's a, a tool operation in the error log, they'll know. We don't need to go out of our way to, to, to tell them. As long as we put a file and line number, that's the rule. For all errors, there has to be a file and line in, that corresponds to the prompt. So, I'm thinking that, yes, this sounds actually quite good. Is there anything else that we do with these, with these scopes being opened and closed? Is it only the tools?

**[p55]** You say first prose block. No, that's not right. It's not the first prose block, it's It's the setup of the last lua block.

**[p56]** What I'm saying is this. In the epilogue. Before we run the epilogue code, we zap the tables. And the most logical way to do that is after the last prose block runs. Then before we execute the Lua, we manipulate the table, so we have one function to zap the environment, and it'll, it'll nil out the model. And it'll null out the tools. Tables.

**[p57]** Keep saying before pros, it was false. When, when is that the case? To me this is what an H2 looks like:

**[p58]** - lua prologue
- prose
- lua
- prose
- lua
- prose
- lua epilog

**[p59]** we want to zap the model/tools tables just before running "lua epilog"

**[p60]** checking if a prose block follows, this is a good criteria actually. if there's no prose block that follows, then tools.add would be useless

**[p61]** plan all the changes we discussed

**[p62]** model can only be set once in a section, and always only allowed in the prologue, and once model.need is called then a subsequent call should fail. can we set the model.need=nil?

**[p63]** is raw_set to nil the same as deleting the key?

**[p64]** why dont we delete then

**[p65]** so when you set it to nil the key is released?

**[p66]** Hey, I see a little problem here, because if, if we do model dot always in the pro in the preamble, then now we have a default. And it applies to every subheading, but now for subheading does model dot Use, now it's overriding the default. But it's on I feel like maybe this isn't the right thing to do. Maybe consider evaluate this new API in the preamble if we call always, then we've permanently foreclosed being able to use. Different models in any subheading, so we never allow them in the table. So you have to make a choice: either you use the same model for the entire prompt or you specify the model every single time in the subhead. You

**[p67]** if there's no model.always, then failure to select a model before the first prose or call to model::inference produces an error

**[p68]** I just realized. The user can call model::inference() from the epilog.

**[p69]** Right but the point is that a call to model::infer would make the epilog no longer "a lua block with no prose that follows"

**[p70]** ```lua
x
model::infer(y)
y
```

**[p71]** must always be equivalent to:

**[p72]** ```lua
x
```

**[p73]** {{ y }}

**[p74]** ```lua
z
```

**[p75]** This is a core design principle. These are equivalent. This way there is never any misunderstanding about what does what. this means the "epilog" is the lua code that is not followed by any call to model::infer or prose.

**[p76]** do we still need ToolBag

**[p77]** I want a sweep through the entire project and all the docs to make this design clear

**[p78]** I want the design principle written down somewhere where do you think is best?

**[p79]** yeah update the plan

**[p80]** we should rename model.always to models.only

**[p81]** bindings.only() ? search for all calls to always() and evaluate the contexts

**[p82]** review the plan. apply @tools-public/rulebooks/vibe-rulebook.md and @tools-public/rulebooks/rust-rulebook.md

**[p83]** stay at runvil: 1 and also fix any tools in the repo

**[p84]** are you going to make a todo list for each step and commit each time?

**[p85]** re-check @tools-public/rulebooks/vibe-rulebook.md

**[p86]** update the plan

**[p87]** fanout() is also like infer()

**[p88]** stop asking me if I am ready, I will tell you when I am ready.

**[p89]** I want to park the fanout change on hold (and any related documentation changes for it) and restructure the plan to do everything else in the logical order

**[p90]** review the plan then run it

**[p91]** what the fuck

**[p92]** I switched to Opus 4.6

**[p93]** update the plan to remove what was finished, leaving just the fanout changes and the docs related to it

**[p94]** Okay, I wanna talk about the fan out. There's a couple of cases that we need to cover. One is when we want to fan out. Multiple prompts. But what if we just want to do two steps at the same time, and they each have their own section? How's that handled?

**[p95]** Here's the problem that I have What we're asking the model to do is, we're asking it to identify all the sections in the paper, and then we're gonna fan out on each section. But in order to extract the text, we need to take the line number range, and we need to read it from the file. The problem is, if we have the model use output tokens for that, then we're wasting output tokens, and then it, it can paraphrase. We don't want that. So what we wanna do is, we wanna have We want the model to identify the line number ranges, but then we want a deter-deterministic way of taking those line number ranges and putting it into files in the store. So there's a, there's an impedance mismatch here with the transition from From the, from the model to the Lua, and the transition from the Lua to the model, this has resistance. So my idea is this: instead of asking the model to just output a bulleted list Of sections and their line numbers, how about if we offer a custom tool on the spot, like a tool that's backed by just a Lua function, and then we ask the model to call the tool, and the tool has just, really just two parameters, the starting line and the ending line? How easy is that? @runvil/local/prompts/papergate.md:28-31

**[p96]** Well, I wanna talk about it. What I wanna know is, can a three billion parameter model reliably call this tool? And we're not using PyDantic, so do we need, like, what if the tool what if the tool call fails? and another thing, I don't wanna have to go through ten or fifteen completions. I don't ha I don't wanna have to wait once for each section. I want the tool to be asynchronous. I want the model to emit a tool call for each section. All at once, like if there's twelve sections in the document, then issue twelve tool calls, and then, and then the model's done, and then the LWO will, will collect all those tool calls and execute them, and then, and then we'll get those results. Like it'll be, like we'll have a rendezvous until all the tool calls are done. What do you think about that?

**[p97]** But are you sure about that? Because check the code, do do we handle a model issuing multiple tool calls? That doesn't make sense. What happens if one of the tool calls is a goto? Or a jump. I don't understand. Or what if one of the tool calls is like. Like a fan out? How can that work?

**[p98]** What about, like, WebFetch and WebSearch? The model's gonna give more than one call? Like, can a model do multiple web searches at once? Is that what it's doing? I don't know if I, how I feel about that. They should do one at a time. How do what, what are the, what are the checks and balances there?

**[p99]** Hey, let's, let's plan the feature. So the feature is this, the feature is you can add a tool, and then it's backed by a Lua function, either a closure, inlined into the Call site or calling a named function that's local to the chunk. What do you think about that?

**[p100]** My thinking is this. If you want If you want to make a tool, if you want to make a local tool be globally available, then you put the function in the shared Lua, which is the last section of the h1, and then, or, or it's marked shared, and then you just, every, every section has to register it.

**[p101]** you fucked up the fence

**[p102]** Question is this. I wanna, so the tool is gonna collect the It's gonna collect the sections, I mean, it doesn't have to inject in the store, it could just accumulate in a table. And then And then after the prose executes, then the next lua chunk will look at the table. So how do we create that variable? Can we have a variable in the first Lua chunk and then the function adds it, that becomes the table that the function uses, and then in the second Lua chunk we inspect it? And then we do the fan out based on that.

**[p103]** the VM is the same for the whole H2 so can't we just use

**[p104]** sections = {}

**[p105]** if we wanted them as numbered files in the store, i.e. "chunk-1.md", "chunk-2.md" how would that look

**[p106]** seems wasteful to duplicate the string

**[p107]** I mean the string of the section

**[p108]** fanout takes a list of store paths?

**[p109]** What if I wanted each item to be a string like "startLine=50, endLine=80"

**[p110]** I'm just thinking out loud here. So, for example, okay, we have, so first, we have the problem of, of injection, prompt injection, because this is from a paper, which is an untrusted source, and then we have the problem that the, there's gonna be line numbers potentially or not. Like, if it's just, if we just have a plain string with the line numbers stripped out, then the fan-out arm isn't gonna know how to map those lines to the original file. And then if we ever wanna attach like line numbers as evidence, then we can't do that anymore. So I'm just trying to think about I'm just trying to think of all the ways that, that we can pass the data. to the, to the fan out children and try to get, do what we want. It's, it's kinda complicated.

**[p111]** I mean, I still wanna, no, I wanna, I want the plan to be a good chunk of functionality. I want the plan to be enough to get me past the next chunk of functionality, because just having the local tool isn't really gonna get me anywhere. So, consider this: what if the fan-out child just gets the line numbers and it has to do a tool call? It's given a tool. And it does a toll call, and it asks for those, that line range. Then! But that's no good either, because what if we, we, we should, we probably wanna do that from the Lua, but we can't because we don't have integers. The Lua wants to see integers. We don't have any way of passing like structured data unless it's in the var. The var can have numbers, right? But wait. You can't use the var. Because Devor is a copy, we just isn't isn't Devor a copy of everything?

**[p112]** We're talking, when we do the fan out though, we'll have to make a copy of item. Right? So We set up item to be the table which has everything for all the arms, and then we index it by the arm's ID.

**[p113]** Planned for this? Do we have a plan?

**[p114]** Yes, I want a fresh plan. And I want the tool, I just want the tools dot local.

**[p115]** you are stuck

**[p116]** you are stuck

**[p117]** Okay, we're, we're looking at the local tool plan. What do you mean no schema? We can't, we can't do no schema. Of course we need a schema. We have to pick the parameter types out of the function declaration.

**[p118]** Wow. What would be, which pattern would be easiest for small models to stay aligned with? Like, what do we, what do we want to give the small model?

**[p119]** Question, is there debug info in Lua? Can the can the execution model extract the names of the local variables at least? Or, sorry, the names of the function arguments? Can I get the names of the function arguments? And then maybe I can just have one string, a comma delimited string of types like this:
"string, integer, integer"

**[p120]** table approach. update the plan

**[p121]** Question, is there any other metadata that we might wanna set on the tool? Like, we might wanna indicate whether it can run asynchronously, or is there a way to set an extended description, or is there a way to annotate each parameter more? And would that help?

**[p122]** Hey Are we following best practices? Based on all everything that we found while searching, are we good?

**[p123]** Ian Question, we don't have any problems, do we? So, do we have to worry about fan out and what happens inside that function? Like, what if the function itself does inference? What if the function tries to do a fan out? What if the function does calls infer, or execute, or jump? Can, can the function call jump?

**[p124]** I'm curious though, you say the tool loop runs Between the law blocks. But why do we do that? Why do we We don't, we shouldn't need that. Like, why, why don't we just set things up once on the entry into the H2 and then leave things alone? Why, why Why do we have a tool loop that changes state? Why do we remove things from the environment? That doesn't make any sense. Show me the code that does that. Show me the file and line.

**[p125]** And you say each block re-installs fresh closures, but no, are we talking about an H2 block or are we talking about a Lua block? Because the two are different things. Like. All the Lua Chunks in the same h two are supposed to share a one vm.

**[p126]** When you say the closures, you mean functions like tools dot add. What do you mean by the closures?

**[p127]** I don't understand, I don't understand why we need to do that. When we create, but each chunk has its own, but a chunk shares the VM. So if I've got two chunks, right, let's say I've got lua pros, lua pros, lua, three chunks. Each of those chunks shares the same VM. Like last reply is just a string. You, you can, we can just set it anytime we want, as long as we're in the lua section. And then in terms of jump, we only need that once. Why would we need it more than once? I don't understand this. They're all just globals to the VM.

**[p128]** Here's what I need you to do: I need you to go through the code and verify every assumption that we just made, is it true? And give me file and line numbers in a bulleted list that shows proof that I can click on so I can look. I wanna commit you to it. And then, I want you to give me an estimate of how much simpler will things get if we weed it all out and redo it.

**[p129]** yes and help me understand what this "execute reads reply from a live global or an Arc<Mutex<Option<String>>> instead of capturing it" means. As far as I'm concerned, `reply` should be a global in the vm

**[p130]** execute() is a Lua function?

**[p131]** okay but the Rust function that implements `execute` gets access to the Lua's vm so can't it just read the value of reply at the time execute() is called?

**[p132]** Now I wonder if the section spawned by execute() should even get `reply`. Maybe it should be nil

**[p133]** Yes I think this is the right call. `reply` is kind of meaningless in the context of calling execute(). What if the previous operation was a fanout() ?

**[p134]** Do the, when the plan executes? For each file, like I want you to look at the file carefully and consider, look at every function, see if every function's truly needed. For example, what is this jump slot poisoned? What is this jump slot mutex? What's all this?

**[p135]** but what is it

**[p136]** I want that removed, but first I need you thoroughly analzye the code

**[p137]** @runvil/crates/runvil-core/src/lua/vm.rs:813 what does this mean to run loaded with or without host?

**[p138]** Also, I dont see a point to restricting things like fanout() just beause a section has no child headings. this is try-hard. its pointless. it is also wrong, in the case where fanout can accept an array

**[p139]** so for the shared library lua, that chunks is "replayed" into each h2 ?

**[p140]** update the plan

**[p141]** So make sure you update the tests, make sure that we have tests for the tool, the Lua tool, make sure that you update the user guides so that there's instructions on how to make the call from Lua to create the tool. Make sure you've got examples.

**[p142]** use @tools-public/rulebooks/rust-rulebook.md and @tools-public/rulebooks/vibe-rulebook.md

**[p143]** review the plan

**[p144]** tools.local needs to be invocable from any lua chunk in an H2 and it should just add the tool for the next prose call

**[p145]** tools.add between prose being a no-op means insufficient test coverage or else we would have caught it

**[p146]** check the tests see if its actually there

**[p147]** update the plan then review the plan

**[p148]** what is LUA-007

**[p149]** I'm confused. An error in a chunk should stop the whole prompt

**[p150]** Sniff the project out a little bit, will ya? Like, go through, go through a few of the key source files that handle the execution and check that if any assumptions are violated. Use five sub-agents right now, check twenty source files. And see if the sources match all of what we know, and if anything looks weird, you let me know.

**[p151]** what exactly does seen_prose affect?

**[p152]** I dont care about observation labels. the observer can just observe the section itself. no need for the granularity

**[p153]** log() should be available to any lua chunk

**[p154]** why do we build the tool scope at all? why not build the schema right before running any prose?

**[p155]** spawn subagents and study the code and tests for everything we are changing. deeply inspect each touched source file. I dont want any mistakes. especially this tool scope change, you made it with minimal inspection

**[p156]** Is 2. A sentinel ToolId reasonable? how much debt would we be adding

**[p157]** what is "server" ?

**[p158]** And Question You notice how, like in this whole conversation, it's been like me discovering that the way that the code works is a little bit unexpected, right? It's like different than how I expected it to work, and we find out little things that have gone stale, we're finding things that no longer hold up based on the changes that we wanna make, or we're finding some stuff that's redundant. My question to you is this, how can I develop a prompt for the model? That will find all that stuff. Like just a general code cleanup, like refactor to make it tighter, remove things that aren't needed. I mean, this seems like a hard problem. Let me show you, let me show you some analysis, and you tell me if it falls into that case. @tools-public/lessons/fan-out-problem-ai-as-critic.md

**[p159]** and can we?

**[p160]** Oh, by the way, we have a problem with the tool, and what I'm realizing is this: a Lua tool should have all the same capabilities as A regular tool, a native Rust tool. And so for example, it should be possible for Lua to install the task tool, in other words, a tool call that spawns a subagent, runs a prompt, and then returns the result to the Lua or the orchestrator, which could be an LLM. But we can't do that, can we? Are we allowed to call execute from inside the tool function, from a Lua tool function? Can we call fan out?

**[p161]** let's keep talking about it

**[p162]** Let's just remove jump, and I think, so I wanna update the plan. I wanna, when, when we remove jump, I want you to put a nice comment there explaining why, so that we don't have to relearn this over and over again. And just, put like just three or four sentences worth of analysis, it's worth it. A couple of, a few sentences now will save us a headache later. Like, put into that comment what an LLM with a fresh context would like to know, if it makes a change in that area, okay? So now I wanna talk about So I wanna talk about model infer, and I wanna talk about fan out, and I wanna talk about execute. So when we call execute, we have a section as context, but when we call infer, does infer get any tools? I don't think it should. Can you check the code? Of course, fanout can get tools because it's getting a section, and sections can have Lua, and Lua installs tools. And then, as far as jump from a handler, no, you can't jump. But you should be able to jump inside the, the Lua that's inside execute. So if we call execute with the section, that section can jump, right? It can be a long chain. And think about how powerful this is, right? Like We can create a tool, we can create a Lua tool that reads variables from the environment like line numbers, IDs, deterministic strings, and then we can do we can make a quick call to infer to do the inference, and then we can take that, we can extract that, and then we can combine it with the deterministic inputs, and then we can return that string. That's a powerful tool call. That's like a custom agent. That's like an agent that does one thing. It combines deterministic Lua data with a one, one or two shot inference. That's the most like, that's the most powerful operation you can do. You get the best of both, you get the determinism of Lua, and then you get the power of inference.

**[p163]** what kind of nonsense question about jump() is this? Lua needs to jump local tool handlers cannot.

**[p164]** I guess my question is. Do we want, should infer start from a fresh context? And can should you be able to specify the model? 'Cause I can see a use case for doing Infer and then choosing the model, like maybe you just want like a little three billion parameter model real quick, get something quick instead of the full expense of, you know, a frontier model. Maybe you just wanna understand a sentence. Like I can see that'd be That's kind of why I have Infer. Infer was never intended to just be a perfect substitute for Prose. If you want Prose, use Prose. If you want to just do a quick inference inline as, you know, as part of some calculation, then you do that. Search the codebase for any evidence of the design objectives for this. And also, I want your analysis. Tell me what you think. Pros and cons. What do you think of having Infer be fresh context, choice of model, no tools?

**[p165]** So one of the design principles of Prompt, Runvil is that we never, we don't have features that let you do the same thing just a different way. So that means Prose is Prose. That means Infer has to be different. We don't wanna have Infer just be another version of Prose, because then we have all the same problems. How do you set the tools? How do What happens if you jump? Like, that's a pain. No, I think, I think Infer should be strictly fresh context, and it's a blocking call, and a string goes in and a string comes out. That's it. String in, string out, no tool call. I think that's the right, I think that's the right call. And Yeah, and it shouldn't share the conversation history, it shouldn't set last reply, and I think there should be model infer should have a two-parameter version where you take the model ID and then you have the string. Oh, yeah, and then you have the input, so I guess three parameters. Yeah, you always, the, the, the, the, the string is required. Of course. Oh, 'cause that's just the prompt. Yeah. Okay, so, yeah, there's just the prompt. So infer just takes two parameters, the model and the prompt. Or if you call it with one parameter, you get the current model, the one that's being used by the block. And I, I think your syntax is interesting where you say like tools you say models dot need. You wanna do that? I think But I'm not sure that works, I thought models had to be chosen in the h1. I, I, is, is, is a prompt allowed to just call models dot need? Anywhere?

**[p166]** "this requires the prompt to pre-declare every model it might want to use" Yes

**[p167]** I'm having second thoughts about models.only.

**[p168]** So one of the design principles of Runvil is that we want every command has to be, should be flexible, it should be able to be multi-purpose and serve duty, and from a small set of primitives, we wanna give the user maximum possibilities. And but another design principle is that we also wanna be we want the user to be able to be brief, we don't wanna be overly verbose. And models dot only, it kinda sucks because I think we should go back to how it was. There's a way to set the default, and then you can override the model per section. That makes more sense because then, like, if you only have one or two exceptions, now you can, you can use models dot, you know, default and That, that seems nicer to me. So I would probably say I want to replace models dot only with models dot default. It doesn't make sense. So if someone wants to do an infer in just one place using a smaller model, now they're forced to call models dot m-m

**[p169]** check the commit log see if the change to models.only is isolated and we might be able to just revert the one commit?

**[p170]** whatever you think is best

**[p171]** show me all the syntax for models and model

**[p172]** what does models.use return

**[p173]** can we return a model handle or would that require serializing the model table

**[p174]** Right, so yes, we should return the handle from use, and also, anywhere that we take a model ID, we should allow a model object, of course. So infer should be able to take the model in the first parameter. I don't understand what model:infer is.

**[p175]** So it should be an error to do any inference before setting. It should be an error to do any prose or infer without specifying a model until you call use. So in practical terms, models dot use can only be called in the first Lua block of a section. And the only way to have a section that contains only pros is if you have a model default. This all should be tested, by the way. Every, all these combinations need tests.

**[p176]** You don't have to code this explicitly:

**[p177]** models.use can only be called in the first Lua block of a section. After that, the model is locked for the section. This is a new constraint.

**[p178]** it just naturally falls out of the rules

**[p179]** I don't like switching models because switching a model in the middle of a block has consequences for the KV cache. Because think about it, now we have a prefix, we have a common prefix of prompt, and now we're gonna switch models, that could be going that could be going to a completely different provider, and then, and that's not visible to the programmer, right? Like it's, I don't I just don't think it's friendly. If you wanna switch models, you go to a different H2. If you wanna preserve context, then you pass it forward in the reply.

**[p180]** review the plan

**[p181]** "For every step, the coder subagent must audit every function it touches:" I want more than that. I want an audit of every function in the file being modified.

**[p182]** we need models.get(id). and we need to keep model:infer obviously. Let's ditch the 2-arg infer() and make models.infer always use the model selected for the H2

**[p183]** is there a difference between quick:infer and quick.infer? and what do you think of this change?

**[p184]** review the plan. get it ready to run in a fresh context

**[p185]** can the steps be further decomposed and still result in each commit producing tests?

**[p186]** fine grained is always better I think?

**[p187]** Are we gonna allow jump from Lua tool handlers?

**[p188]** what if the prompt has two sections:

**[p189]** ## Gate A

**[p190]** ## Gate B

**[p191]** And I want to install a Lua tool handler which lets the model choose gate a or gate by, and the tool implements this choice by calling jump()?

**[p192]** the epilog would work today

**[p193]** how many lines added/removed total? how much cleanup/refactoring?

**[p194]** @runvil/local/prompts/papergate.md:26-28 add the tool, make it record each call into the `sections` variable

**[p195]** @runvil/local/prompts/papergate.md:31 would sections:insert also work

**[p196]** @runvil/local/prompts/papergate.md:30 is there a way specify that the function takes 3 args?

**[p197]** @runvil/local/prompts/papergate.md:44 modify the prose to call the tool

**[p198]** would it be nicer to not name the tool and just talk about behavior

**[p199]** make the change and also reconsider line 40

**[p200]** @runvil/local/prompts/papergate.md:47-48 now modify this so it writes the contents of `sections` as a bulleted list of section names with the line number range in parenthesis at the end



## Plans

### fanout-scope-refactor

*Three changes to runvil: (1) fanout() accepts a Lua array as second arg + new items() function, (2) replace ToolPhase/ModelRuntime scope lifecycle with a freeze_declarations() that nils mutating table entries before Lua blocks with no following prose, (3) extract_output already fixed (clean output without separator).*

## Plan

### 1. fanout() accepts Lua array + new items() function

**Goal:** `fanout(worker, items)` where `items` is either a section heading string (current) or a Lua array of strings (new). New `items(heading)` function extracts pre-parsed bullet items from a list section.

**Files:**

- `runvil/crates/runvil-core/src/lua/vm.rs` (line ~1106): Change the `fanout` Lua function signature from `(String, String)` to `(String, Value)`. When `Value` is a string, resolve as section heading (current behavior). When it's a table, extract string items directly. Also add `items` as a new Lua global that takes a heading string and returns the section's pre-parsed items as a Lua table.

- `runvil/crates/runvil-core/src/execute/engine.rs` (line ~566, `make_fanout_callback`): Change signature to accept `items: Vec<String>` directly instead of resolving from a list section. The callback in `run_section_lua` handles the string-vs-table dispatch before calling `make_fanout_callback`.

- `runvil/crates/runvil-core/src/fanout/mod.rs`: `run_fanout_arms` already takes `items: &[String]` - no change needed there. The `resolve_sibling` call for the list section moves from `make_fanout_callback` into the Lua-facing dispatch code.

- `runvil/crates/runvil-core/src/fanout/arm.rs`: Check if `ToolPhase` is referenced (it imports it) - remove if unused after scope cleanup.

### 2. Replace scope lifecycle with freeze_declarations()

**Goal:** Remove `ToolPhase`, `ModelRuntime` open/closed state, `ClosedScopes`, `close_scopes()`, `prepare_tool_scope()`, `commit_tool_scope_closed()`, `require_closed_tool_scope()`, `close_model_scope()`, and all scope-related observer events. Replace with a single `freeze_declarations()` function called before any Lua block that has no following prose block.

**Approach:**

New function in `vm.rs` or a new module:

```rust
fn freeze_declarations(lua: &Lua) -> Result<()> {
    let globals = lua.globals();
    let tools: Table = globals.raw_get("tools")?;
    tools.raw_set("add", Value::Nil)?;
    tools.raw_set("need", Value::Nil)?;
    tools.raw_set("always", Value::Nil)?;
    let models: Table = globals.raw_get("models")?;
    models.raw_set("use", Value::Nil)?;
    models.raw_set("need", Value::Nil)?;
    models.raw_set("always", Value::Nil)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

In `engine.rs` `run_one_section`, before calling `run_section_lua` for a Lua block, check if any prose blocks follow:

```rust
let has_later_prose = section.blocks[index + 1..]
    .iter().any(|b| matches!(b, Block::Prose { .. }));
if !has_later_prose {
    freeze_declarations(vm.lua())?;
}
```

**Files to modify:**

- `runvil/crates/runvil-core/src/lua/scope.rs`: Delete `ToolPhase`, `ClosedScopes`, `ToolRuntime.phase` field. Keep `ToolScope`, `ToolRuntime` (minus phase), `ToolCallCounts`.

- `runvil/crates/runvil-core/src/lua/vm.rs`: Delete `close_scopes()`, `close_tool_scope()`, `prepare_tool_scope()`, `commit_tool_scope_closed()`, `require_closed_tool_scope()`. Remove `ToolPhase` from `ToolRuntime` initialization. Add `freeze_declarations()`. Remove `require_closed_tool_scope` calls from `bind_reply`, `run_epilog`, `run_epilog_with_control`.

- `runvil/crates/runvil-core/src/lua/tools_bridge.rs` (line ~165): Remove the `ToolPhase::H2` check in `tools.add`.

- `runvil/crates/runvil-core/src/lua_models/mod.rs`: Simplify `ModelRuntime` from enum to just `Option<String>` (the used selection). Delete `close_model_scope()`, `close_model_scope_inner()`. Remove `is_open()` checks in `install_h2_models`. The `models.use` at-most-once check stays via `SelectError::AlreadyUsed`.

- `runvil/crates/runvil-core/src/execute/engine.rs`: Replace `close_scopes()` call with `snapshot_tool_scope()` + `freeze_declarations()` at the right point. Remove `scopes_ready` tracking. The model binding resolution moves from `close_model_scope` to a direct read of `ModelRuntime.used()` (or the always fallback).

- `runvil/crates/runvil-core/src/observe.rs`: Remove `ToolScopeClosing`, `ToolScopeClosed`, `ToolScopeFailed`, `ModelScopeClosing`, `ModelScopeClosed`, `ModelScopeFailed` variants and their display strings and `detail::` constants.

- `runvil/crates/runvil-core/src/fanout/arm.rs`: Remove `ToolPhase` import if unused after cleanup.

**Schema computation:** Replace `close_scopes()` with `snapshot_tool_scope()` (already exists at vm.rs line 1270) which reads bindings without closing. For the model side, read `ModelRuntime.used()` directly or fall back to `bindings.always()`.

**sys.model enrichment:** Currently happens inside the `close_scopes` block in engine.rs (line 353-368). With the freeze approach, model resolution happens at the same point (first prose block) using the snapshot functions. `sys.model` becomes available at the same time as before.

### 3. extract_output cleanup (already done)

Already implemented and verified. No further changes needed.

### Test updates

- `lua/tests.rs` (~18 references to close_scopes/ToolPhase): Update tests that exercise the close lifecycle to test the freeze behavior instead
- `model/tests/integration.rs`, `model/tests/always.rs`: Update model scope close tests
- `execute/tests/model_and_reply.rs` (lines 429-452): Tests for `sys.model` availability timing need updating
- `execute/tests/tool_scoping.rs`: Tests that reference `ToolScope` directly need updating
- `execute/tests/tool_bag.rs`: Tests referencing `ToolCallCounts` stay (that struct survives)
- `execute/tests/debug_and_counts.rs`: Tests for out-of-scope tool calls stay (that's dispatch validation, not scope lifecycle)
- New tests: `fanout` with Lua array input, `items()` function, `freeze_declarations` behavior

### Order of work

1. First: scope removal (freeze_declarations) - this is the foundational change
2. Second: fanout array support + items() - builds on the cleaned-up VM
3. Run full test suite after each step


Todos:

- Remove ToolPhase/ModelRuntime scope lifecycle, add freeze_declarations(), update engine.rs to use snapshot + freeze
- Update all tests referencing close_scopes, ToolPhase, ClosedScopes, ModelScope events
- fanout() accepts Lua array as second arg, dispatch on Value type in Lua binding
- Add items(heading) Lua function that returns a section's pre-parsed bullet items
- Tests for fanout with array, items(), and freeze_declarations behavior
- Remove unused observer events, dead code, verify no remaining references to removed types

### tools-local

*Add tools.local(alias, description, handler) to runvil - a Lua-backed tool that the model can call during inference. The handler is a Lua function that receives args as a table and returns a string.*

# tools.local - Lua-backed tools

## What it is

`tools.local(alias, description, handler)` declares a tool backed by a Lua function. When the model calls this tool during inference, the tool loop invokes the Lua handler instead of an external service. The handler receives `args` as a Lua table (whatever JSON the model passed) and returns a string (the tool result the model sees).

## Lua API

```lua
tools.local("extract_section", "Extract a range of lines from the paper", function(args)
    -- args is whatever the model passes as JSON, deserialized to a Lua table
    local content = store.read_lines("paper.md")
    -- slice from args.start_line to args.end_line
    store.write("sections/" .. args.name .. ".md", sliced)
    return "stored " .. args.name
end)
```

- Called from any Lua block (H1 or H2 prologue)
- Alias follows the same `[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_-]{0,63}` rule as `tools.need`
- The tool is immediately available to the model (no separate `tools.add` needed - `tools.local` both declares and scopes it)
- Handler defined in `lua shared` can be referenced by name from any section
- No parameter schema - the model infers argument structure from the description
- Handler has access to the section's `store` and globals (same VM)
- Handler returns a string; errors propagate as tool-call failures

## Design decisions

- **No schema:** The model sees only `{name, description}` with no `parameters` object. This keeps the API simple. The model figures out what to pass from the prompt context.
- **Trusted output:** Local tool output is trusted (no nonce wrapping) since the prompt author wrote the handler. This matches the trust model - the prompt is trusted, external data is not.
- **Same VM:** The handler runs in the section VM that declared it, so it shares globals, store handle, and upvalues. This is what makes the accumulator pattern work.
- **Sequential dispatch:** Multiple local tool calls in one response execute sequentially in the for loop, same as external tools. Fine for store operations.

## Implementation

### Where tools live in the architecture

- `Tool` trait (`crates/runvil-core/src/tools.rs`): `call(args: Value) -> Result<ToolOutput>`
- `ToolRegistry`: holds `Arc<dyn Tool>` by `ToolId`
- `ToolSchema`: the JSON schema sent to the model per tool
- Tool loop (`execute/tool_loop.rs` line ~215): dispatches via `registry.get(&id)` then `tool.call(args)`
- `ToolBinding`: carries alias, wire name, tool ID, description

### The problem

Local tools can't go through `ToolRegistry` in the normal way because:
1. They don't exist at H1 resolution time (or they might, but their handler is a Lua closure tied to a specific VM)
2. The handler needs access to the section VM's state (store, globals)
3. They're per-section, not global

### Approach

A local tool is NOT a `dyn Tool` in the registry. Instead:

1. `tools.local(alias, desc, handler)` in Lua stores the handler function in a per-VM local-tools table (alongside the alias and description)
2. When building tool schemas for inference, local tools are included alongside registry tools - they generate a schema with just `{name, description}` and no parameters
3. In the tool dispatch loop, before looking up in `registry.get(&id)`, check if the call name matches a local tool alias. If so, call the Lua handler directly from within the tool loop
4. The Lua handler call bridges from async Rust into the Lua VM via `block_in_place` (same pattern as `model:infer`)

### Files to modify

- `crates/runvil-core/src/lua/vm.rs`: Add storage for local tool handlers (a `HashMap<String, mlua::RegistryKey>` or similar). Add a method to register a local tool. Add a method to call a local tool handler by alias.

- `crates/runvil-core/src/lua/tools_bridge.rs` (or new file `lua/local_tools.rs`): Install the `tools.local` Lua function. It validates the alias, stores the handler, and records the binding.

- `crates/runvil-core/src/execute/tool_loop.rs` (line ~215): Before `registry.get(&id)`, check if the call name is a local tool. If so, call the VM's local handler. Need access to the VM or a dispatch closure from the engine.

- `crates/runvil-core/src/execute/engine.rs`: Thread local tool info into the tool loop. The prose inference call needs to know about local tools for both schema building and dispatch.

- `crates/runvil-core/src/execute/tools.rs` (`ToolBag`/`InferContext`): Same - `model:infer` from Lua also needs to dispatch local tools.

- `crates/runvil-core/src/tools.rs`: May need a `LocalToolSchema` or an extension to `ToolSchema` for schema-less tools.

### Steps

1. **Add local tool storage to SectionVm.** A table mapping alias to (description, handler registry key). Method to register. Method to call.

2. **Install `tools.local` Lua function.** In `tools_bridge.rs` or a new file. Validates alias, stores handler in VM, records the binding so it appears in the effective scope.

3. **Include local tools in schema building.** When `snapshot_tool_scope` or `ToolBag::prepare` builds schemas, include local tools with name+description only (no parameters object).

4. **Dispatch local tools in the tool loop.** Before registry lookup, check local tools. Call the handler via the VM. Return the string as `ToolOutput::trusted(result)`.

5. **Wire into `model:infer` path.** The `InferContext` also needs local tool dispatch.

6. **Tests.** A prompt with `tools.local` that the model calls. Verify the handler runs, its return is the tool result, store mutations persist, multiple calls in one response work.

7. **Documentation.** Update design-core.md, guide/src/lua.md, guide/src/tools.md.
