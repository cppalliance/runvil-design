## Not converted

- "Should we do files or should we do state?" [p341] - an open musing on the state model, no directive landed.
- Line-offset table versus character ranges for edit tools [p343-p344] - a question about established practice, not a position.
- Sharded-mutex lock contention idea [p350-p351] - a performance implementation note the user explicitly deferred ("not something to worry about now").
- Sub-agent doing web search then web fetch into a virtual file [p355] - a usage scenario probing capability, not a directive.
- The web_fetch SSRF security surface (CIDR tables, redirect re-checks, size caps, content-type routing) [plans: webfetch crate extraction] - tool implementation spec, not language or engine behavior.
- Model tiering per section [plans: Orchestrator Design Document] - a convertible principle dropped only because the 20-candidate cap favored more general records.
- Lua sandbox contents (empty globals, safe stdlib only, instruction-count hook) [plans: Lua args substitution] - convertible but dropped at the cap; the module allowlist is also partly a technology choice.
- State tiering (files primary, counters for audit, store for the rest) [plans: Runvil Executor Tranche 1] - convertible but dropped at the cap.

  rejected-alternative: starting with an interpreted host language and bolting prompts onto it

## Not converted

- [p76] Naming preference: "args" over "params" for prompt parameters.
- [p84] Anxiety that twenty large per-tool schemas recreate the pydantic burden, just shifted into Lua.
- [p92], [p93] Open sandboxing worries: infinite loops in prompt Lua, and tools gaining file read/write through the Lua library.
- [p94] Belief that people will use prompt Lua for general-purpose computation, so static tool detection may never be complete.
- [p96], [p100] Open exploration of making the file the unit of state, tempered by the corrective that structured data like breadcrumbs still exists.
- [p123], [p129] Build-sequencing preference: one big plan implemented in subtractive tranches, starting from a hello-world executor invoked from the command line.
- [p130], [p131], [p132] Repo bookkeeping preferences: a cumulative status file and AGENTS.md at the root rather than .mdc rules.

- Model sovereignty: the standing temperament that every design decision should make mid-size open-weight models reliable at roughly 1/100th of frontier API cost (design document BLUF).
- "Minimize the amount of inference" as a general instinct behind several rulings [p67, p69].
- The transcript compaction algorithm (recursive halving, fidelity gradient, prompt reinjection, pre-compaction at 90%) - real directives, but scoped to Mentographist and explicitly declared not part of the orchestrator [p2, p15, p31, plans appendix].
- Chat-format preferences ("dont code fence me" [p12, p26], blockquote user text [p59]) - transcript formatting, not Runvil design.
- Open-weight hardware and latency discussion (model sizes, gaming cards, STT/TTS budget) [p4-p10, p38] - capability scouting, no behavioral directive.

## Not converted

- Skepticism about Gemma's reliability at tool calling ("that's its one fucking job") - a model-quality grievance, not a directive [p249], [p303].
- Staged definition of "beautiful" output (parity with local qwen, then surpass it, then three rounds of no improvement before switching subjects) - an experimentation methodology [p320].
- Optimize web-search agents for as few turns as possible - a tuning preference [p321].
- Do not bias a prompt toward a class of subject ("don't make the prompt biased to favor non-profits"; say "corporate filings") - a prompt-authoring neutrality preference [p325], [p326].
- A/B test thinking on/off across models and iterate until no axis improves; review code every 3 commits - a working style [p346], [p348].
- Commit uncommitted WIP before starting plan work - a workflow habit [p259], [p291].
- Preference for cribbing other people's code from the internet to make things work - an implementation attitude [p253].

- A prompt is a work of art; the single-prompt format is loved for its own sake. [p4]
- Design documents are provisional and lower priority than the conversation, always; conversation decisions override anything written in them. [p5], [p6], [plans section]
- Lua spawning sub-agents and blocking to collect their results into variables or a map was explored as a scenario, not decided. [p32]
- Dividing the problem space into synchronous and asynchronous halves is the way to make progress. [p36]
- Manual per-item fan-out markup that turns thirty lines into a hundred is not worth it; the ergonomics were left unresolved. [p46]

- Flavor text must be genuine, lightly adapted Gibson fragments with every sentence reviewed for sense; nonsense imagery is called out by name. (aesthetic craft standard, [p54]-[p57])
- The finished result must be chefs-kiss; the recurring worry is whether the work is making the code cleaner or just bloating and smearing it around. (quality temperament, [p22], [p23], [p59])
- Wip commits pushed to the remote are a cheap backup and are kept. (pragmatism, [p26], [p27])
- The mess is self-diagnosed: vibe-coding for days without technical-debt refactors along the way is what produced the findings pileup. (philosophy of debt, [p30])
- When a run goes sideways, stop and interrogate the state before touching anything: is the top commit better than before, and how much would a reset lose. (temperament under failure, [p10]-[p12])

- Every time a model rewrites an artifact it resamples toward the mean of the distribution (top-k) and away from argmax, like gaussian blur in semantic space; only a significant correction counteracts it. [p1], [p3]
- First-pass generation is the sharpest pass: one pass, one prompt. [p3], [p4]
- The blur of a regenerated artifact is proportional to how many tokens of the input came from the model. [p38]
- The output of a blurred plan can still be as sharp as the original, because the plan's design choices survive even when its rationale is sanded down. [p47]
- No comparison algorithm, however good, prevents slow bloat over repeated regenerate-and-repair cycles; blurred content smears and takes up more space. [p48], [p49]
- Cropping a blurred plan makes it smaller but loses information each time, so over many cycles the plan returns to the same size with its instructions sanded down. [p54]
- A model cannot sharpen without external information. [p55]
- Open question the user kept circling: what operation shrinks a plan without blurring it, and how can a model compress without smoothing? [p51], [p53]
- Cursor plan files are machine-local and not portable via git; skills are the better portable mechanism today. (Excluded as a technology/mechanism choice, not a behavior.) [p12], [p22]

- Planning workflow preference: put everything in one plan, implement a working subset, subtract it, and iterate in tranches across the executor, gateway, and MCP service [p123].
- Repo bookkeeping preference: keep a status file (AGENTS.md at the root, not .mdc) that all changes must update so a fresh context knows the project state [p130, p131, p132].
- Doubt, unresolved: Lua will be used for general-purpose computation, so static detection of every tool call may not be reliable - this tensions with the load-time tool-discovery principle [p94].
- Open worries with no directive: Lua code going into an infinite loop, and tools gaining file read/write access through the Lua library [p92, p93].
- Design pressure, not a directive: many large per-tool schemas risk recreating the pydantic burden by shifting it into Lua [p84].

## Not converted

- The best engineers are lazy; the best kind of feature delivers everything with the minimal implementation (p231).
- Earlier design documents are bloat to be mined for ideas, not followed (p232, p233).
- Build in the smallest testable increments: Lua first, then args, then substitution, with an echo tool as the first commit (p250, p276, p293).
- Every commit carries tests, code review, and docs, and each commit makes progress on its own rather than needing a later commit to realize it (p292, p312).
- Keep a lightweight vibe-coding addendum and inject it into the context periodically to keep it fresh (p297-p302).
- Loading a how-to-write-prompts guide into plans works like a miracle (p299).
- Prefix caching is irrelevant at 3B model scale; tiny context windows are what drive the context engineering (p258, p259).

- Prefers direct answers without hedging: "Don't fence answers" [p51].
- Security mechanisms must justify themselves: asked whether the data-not-instructions preface actually makes a difference [p26].
- Names should come from vocabulary every prompt writer already owns: "reply" is right because everyone understands "the model's reply" [p58].
- Floats naming ideas as questions, expecting discussion rather than immediate execution [p45].
- Ship the static form first and add the dynamic feature later [p63].

- Workflow discipline: one adversarial review per commit with fixes amended in, design doc and user docs kept current as work proceeds [p74].

- Temperature should be zero for analytical pipelines [p105] - a usage preference, not an engine directive.

- Architecture should be "lean, slender, and good" [p122] - temperament behind the normalization-layer principle, not itself a rule.
- If the store is a real filesystem, intermediate artifacts like evidence.md become useless files [p162] - a stated worry, no directive issued.
- Turnaround time on changes is painfully slow [p91] - impatience with the dev loop, no design rule.

- Curiosity about the difference between an API key and a bearer token; a terminology question that informed the rename but carries no directive. [p26]

- Musing on whether more thinking would have prevented the skipped commits; a temperament question, not a directive. [p38]
- runvil.md names local/prompts.toml as the prompt registry. (Config-location fact, not a behavior.) [p4]

- Prefer shipping the permissive, simpler design now and tightening later with evidence ([p11]); in tension with the replay gate that was ultimately adopted.
- A correct generalization should simplify the implementation by eliminating special cases ([p43], [p60]).
- Ask for evidence before choosing an API shape, then answer from first principles when the evidence is already in hand ([p17], [p18]).
- Efficiency instinct: an API that forces reading 5,000 lines to extract 400 is wasteful ([p15]).
- Delight in elegant synthesis wherever it comes from; the jump-into-child-walk solution was found by the AI and credited as luck ([p66]-[p72]).
- Plans should stand alone ([p81]).

- Compression is the most valuable substance in the AI universe; the antislab. [p67]
- Start from the most compressed version of the idea, the highest-frequency signals; the chat itself is the substance and the human supplies the decision-making. [p68]
- Distrust quick confident answers; demand to see the actual mechanism, not a simulation of one. [p85]
- A report should open experientially and take the reader on the same journey the author took. [p94]
- An illustrative example may be approximate if it is close enough to reality to teach the reader. [p98]

- "The best engineers are lazy" - the best feature gives everything for the minimal implementation (p231).
- design-runvil.md is overengineered bloatslop; mine it for ideas only (p232, p233).
- Build in the smallest testable increments: Lua plus args plus substitution first, "echo" as the first commit, fall-through as one testable thing (p250, p276, p293).
- Args without Lua is too little; Lua is needed to return values (p277, p278).
- Prefix caching is irrelevant at 3B; a 3B model has a tiny context window (p258, p259).
- The consolidated single tool call existed because small-model sections were assumed to need many call kinds at once; large models may not need it (p224, p225).
- Each commit must have tests, code review, docs, and user docs, and each commit must make self-sufficient progress rather than needing a later commit to retroactively realize it (p292, p312).
- Wants a lightweight vibe-coding how-to, roughly one fifth of how-to-vibe-code, injected into context periodically (p297-p302); loading how-to-write-prompts.md into plans "works like a miracle" (p299).
- Implement all features and let the caller decide, with sensible defaults (p316).

- Skepticism about hardening when the operator controls all MCP servers: "why do I care about all of this hardening if I control all the mcp servers?" [p14]
- Preference for partial fine-tuning that buys a bounded improvement without degeneracy, rather than going "all the way" [p22]
- Eval data should be generated by multiple models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Cursor) to avoid same-generator bias [p51]
- Working style: run all jobs asynchronously so the conversation can continue [p23], [p46]
- Inspect raw data samples together before committing to a theory ("pick 30 descriptions at random... let's look at it together") [p57]
- Plans should ship with a separate rationale document that mines the chat history and explains the why behind the design [p82]
- A fast, high-confidence "trivial reject" stage may drop clearly mismatched tools before finer matching, tolerating false negatives but never false positives [p55]

- [p13] Hesitation about gateway-side URL fetching: if the model might do the fetching itself, gateway fetching becomes ambiguous. Unresolved preference, no directive landed.
- [p19] Open question whether the common one-file-in/one-file-out case deserves its own special syntax. Floated, never decided.
- [p27] Documentation workflow preference: integrate new design into the existing per-crate design docs instead of generating a new document. Process directive, not engine behavior.
- [p34] Rule-authoring philosophy: loosen a workspace rule with an "unless" clause and tighten rulebooks into standalone imperatives. About rule governance, not Runvil.
- [p56] Temperament about verified work: every commit must have tests that were actually run, confirmed commit by commit. Process demand, not a design principle.
- [p58] Session-reuse goal for the quickref: services launched once should be remembered and reused across repeated prompt runs in the same chat. A doc purpose statement, not a directive on the engine.

- Minute-scale per-prompt latency is treated as a defect worth attacking, not a fact of life [p81], [p91].
- Heavyweight process rulebooks get lightened when they slow the development loop [p116].
- Review loops stop after one round of amend; more rounds only surface noise [p117].
- Architecture should be lean and slender; scope creep that later proves necessary is accepted by definition, because that is what normalizing means [p122], [p124].
- Abstraction risks such as trait cosplay are discounted when removal is trivially easy [p124].
- Defaults are interrogated against intuition before acceptance, as with the skepticism that turning off thinking could help analysis [p106].

- A rulebook that is itself the product of blurring can still produce sharp outputs [p122-p123].
- Token dropping has legitimate uses (tool catalogs over 100 tools, shrinking WG21 papers) even though it is wrong for the author's own prompts [p117-p118].
- The author's prompt-writing practice: enter plan mode, state the goal, apply how-to-write-prompts.md, keep refining, ask for a review pass that tightens, then run [p156].
- Test your own prior before acting on it: verify that sharpening a sharply produced tool actually strips what you predicted it would strip [p158].
- A high-value, high-leverage audit warrants line-by-line comparison of original against sharpened output [p160].
- The prompt rulebook absorbs external influence (an Anthropic context-engineering blog post) and may drift ahead of older exemplars [p150].

- The user worried whether a small fine-tuned reduce model can robustly handle inputs containing code fences and mixed languages (C++, JavaScript); a robustness concern raised as a question, never resolved into a directive [p8].
- Model sovereignty as a design goal: the design prefers self-hosted small models over frontier APIs for cost and speed independence; a philosophy, not a rule [design documents section].
- Report-craft preferences (inverted pyramid, inline hyperlinks, answer-first headings) govern the design documents Runvil produces, not the language or engine itself [p2].

- Deeply nested task chains stay debuggable when each subtask is well tested and well defined. [p19]
- Open question: how the tool-call approach to structured output recognizes failure modes the way Pydantic does. [p24]
- A tool can write itself when its prompt lives in embedded code as individual sections. [p45]
- Most feature requests are specific examples of a few general principles. [p48]
- A design document should be richly detailed enough for any frontier model to produce working code including tests. [p37]
- Compaction with prompt re-injection belongs to the Mentographist app, not this system; the user explicitly separated the two. [p15], [p31]
- The detour on running an unmodified prompt by passing it whole to one model was explicitly excluded from the plan. [p51], [p54]

- Recursive transcript compaction (halving cycles, prompt reinjection, pre-compaction at 90% capacity, full transcript persisted): a Mentographist algorithm, explicitly declared unrelated to the orchestrator.
- Evaluate every design choice by whether it relieves context-window pressure so smaller models suffice: a design heuristic, not a behavior of the language or engine.
- Open-weight model tier economics and "this runs at scale, not on macbooks": deployment posture, not language design.
- Interactive prompts (AskQuestion) have no place in these pipelines: a pipeline-authoring convention rather than an engine behavior.
- Tranche-based plan implementation (implement a subset, subtract it, plan the next) and research-before-writing report workflow: process guidance, not Runvil design.
- "Don't code fence me": chat output-formatting preference.

## Not converted

- [p244] A model that hallucinates is useless no matter its size; trust in the model's output is the whole point (temperament about model quality, not an engine directive).
- [p249], [p250] Frustration that tool-calling is a model's one job; the urgency behind the normalization layer, already captured as a candidate.
- [p319], [p320], [p321] Iterative prompt-tuning methodology: stage quality targets against a baseline, log what works and what does not, roll back anything that regresses, minimize agent turns, and stop after three rounds without improvement (a practice, not a rule of the language or engine).
- [p255] Preference for asynchronous background research while prompting continues (agent workflow, not Runvil behavior).

- Small models carry a narrow vocabulary; vocabulary lives in pretraining, not in the fine-tune set. [p184]

- The user interrogates every phrase of the rulebook; no wording survives unexamined. [p208], [p209], [p211], [p219]
- The endeavor keeps living out its own thesis: every tightening pass regenerates the disease it studies. [p220], [p221]

- The gateway executable may be as big as it needs to be; operational simplicity beats binary size [p16].
- The author works through an AI-driven workflow and feels layers of software between operator and machine; the design should collapse those layers [p16].
- Quantization quality bar: "Q4 sounds terrible" - skepticism toward heavy quantization for serious work [p4].
- GPU support must not be forced on anyone; a machine without CUDA still gets a working gateway [p46] - excluded as a build/technology choice, kept as a sensibility note.
- Build order preference: easiest and most useful first, hardest and most risky last [p38].
- Review process preference: exactly one round of review, edits made in the review context, because further rounds keep finding things forever [p45].
- Deadline temperament: "you will get it done in 2 hours" [p40].

- A design document is mostly why; code contains what, and where nothing forces a choice, that fact is worth stating rather than papering over. [plans section]
- The bet behind rationale recovery: most design choices are forced by constraints that are themselves visible in the code, so the why is largely recoverable. [plans section]
- Contingency is unrecoverable from code; numbers chosen inside a range, facts learned outside the repository, and deleted alternatives leave no trace, so a high open count is honest archaeology, not failure of effort. [plans section]
- "What lost and why" is the most valuable line a design document has. [plans section]
- The user wants prompts to be first-class citizens in the harness and research output delivered into the chat, not into side boxes. [p24]

- [p376] After first-class tools arrive, the VM can no longer be assumed fixed once the preamble has run; it can change after each completion.
- [p395] Unshipped code earns no compatibility concessions: "there's no one to break."
- [p401] Encapsulation is plain programming hygiene; an abstraction earns its keep by being mockable and testable.
- [p411] Big changes get a deep, subagent-driven evaluation before adoption; thoroughness scales with blast radius.
- [p412] The phase transition's only real point is to protect the epilogue.
- [p432] The conversation is preeminent: design documents must be rewritten to match what was settled in discussion.
- [p436] Documentation teaches progressively: one new concept per section, no forward references, every example a complete runnable prompt.
- [p440] Front-page documentation is crisp, bottom-line-up-front, dense and scannable - it says what the thing is rather than performing cool.

- [p29] Whether {{ reply }} substitution injects information versus instructions is ambiguous and was raised as an open question, never resolved into a rule.
- [p30] Imperfect model output is acceptable because the user can always fix it.
- [p67] Tool call limits may be unnecessary at all; a large model concludes before overflow and a small model's context fills up and errors, which is a natural bound.

## Candidates

(none - the unit is a single plan-execution dispatch prompt; it directs workflow, not language or engine behavior, so nothing passes the altitude test)

## Not converted

- When executing a plan, do not pause for reversible choices: make the plan's stated decision, record any necessary falsifier in design-core.md, and continue. [p1]
- Preserve the original design document (design-core-orig.md) byte-for-byte as the historical record. [p1]
- Fix every failure you introduce; run targeted tests as you proceed, then the full verification commands. [p1]

- Review is read-only: the reviewer reports findings and never fixes or commits anything itself. A work-discipline rule for the review step, not a rule of the language or engine.
- Report back in under 80 words with the finding count and the most serious finding. A terse-reporting preference, bookkeeping.
- Write nothing for a check that passes. A signal-to-noise preference for review output, subsumed by the review discipline.

## Not converted

- [p145] Open question, never resolved in this unit: should skipping a heading level be an error?
- [p189] Sequencing temperament: make a little progress on a lot of things instead of a lot of progress on a few; build the known-quantity skeleton (the gateway) first while control flow is still uncertain.
- [p158] Aesthetic conviction: there is something powerful about a small tool set plus prose with the model left to figure it out (partially converted into the tool-minimality and model-autonomy records above).

## Not converted

- The author controls all the MCP servers, so hardening against hostile servers feels like wasted effort - a threat-model posture, not a directive. [p14]
- Accuracy is felt as a per-call error rate ("0.80 means one out of five tool calls will be wrong") - the stakes framing behind the abstention design. [p32]
- "Do everything asynchronously" - a working-style preference for the spike tooling, not the engine. [p46]
- Dataset-building craft: generate need strings with multiple models, and derive them by paraphrasing the descriptions of tools the author already intends to use. [p51] [p59] [p60]
- Inspect raw samples together before trusting a metric ("pick 30 descriptions at random... let's look at it together"). [p57]
- Process preferences: design doc first, then dataset, then reconcile the cited numbers; every design gets a companion rationale document mined from the chat history. [p75] [p82]
- A stream of clever matcher variants (vocabulary word-counts, noun/verb embedding channels, category routing with per-category models, dynamic LoRA pools) - all later measured and rejected; the temperament is propose freely, then let measurement kill. [p28] [p29] [p30] [p31] [p33]
- A trivial-reject pre-filter with no false rejections, pairing and categorizing tools to discard obvious mismatches fast - proposed, later rejected as hard category routing. [p55]
- Reconciliation rule from the plan: preliminary figures must be replaced by reproduced numbers, and any figure that moves enough to threaten a design choice gets flagged rather than silently patched. [plans section]

## Not converted

- "The markdown is the program, the model is the CPU, embedded Lua is the microcode, and the harness is the instruction decoder" - the defining metaphor of the whole design.
- Model sovereignty: every design decision (context clearing, flat tool calls, per-section scoping, fan-out to small models) is chosen to make mid-size open-weight models reliable.
- Integrity stance: subagent prompts are shipped verbatim from named sections rather than paraphrased by the model; what you test is what runs.
- Unit of testing equals unit of composition; each section is testable in isolation with known inputs.
- Honest-limits temperament on guard-wrapping untrusted tool output: a probabilistic mitigation, not a boundary; the hard controls are scoping and context-clearing isolation.
- Sequencing preference: structure the work as the shortest line to a working Cursor integration and push all later complexity much later.
- Lesson from Playbooks prior art: never put a compilation step between the prompt author and the model; the raw markdown is the program.
- Development ergonomics: the service picks up config and directory changes without a restart, and invoking an uninstalled prompt simply errors.

## Not converted

- Less code to maintain beats bespoke machinery; prefer nil-ing out a table over building a dedicated error path. [p53] [p54]
- When a feature is removed, leave a short comment explaining why, written for a fresh-context reader. [p162]
- A Lua tool that combines deterministic data with a one-shot inference is the most powerful operation available: determinism plus model judgment. [p162]
- A silent no-op (tools.add between prose blocks) is taken as evidence of insufficient test coverage. [p145]
- The primitives should feel like one family: fanout is like infer. [p87]
- An itch for a general cleanup pass that finds stale, redundant, or tightened code across the codebase. [p134] [p158]
- Instinct against duplicating data: pass store paths rather than copying section strings. [p105] [p106]
