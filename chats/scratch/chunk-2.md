- Every time a model rewrites an artifact it resamples toward the mean of the distribution (top-k) and away from argmax, like gaussian blur in semantic space; only a significant correction counteracts it. [p1], [p3]
- First-pass generation is the sharpest pass: one pass, one prompt. [p3], [p4]
- The blur of a regenerated artifact is proportional to how many tokens of the input came from the model. [p38]
- The output of a blurred plan can still be as sharp as the original, because the plan's design choices survive even when its rationale is sanded down. [p47]
- No comparison algorithm, however good, prevents slow bloat over repeated regenerate-and-repair cycles; blurred content smears and takes up more space. [p48], [p49]
- Cropping a blurred plan makes it smaller but loses information each time, so over many cycles the plan returns to the same size with its instructions sanded down. [p54]
- A model cannot sharpen without external information. [p55]
- Open question the user kept circling: what operation shrinks a plan without blurring it, and how can a model compress without smoothing? [p51], [p53]
- Cursor plan files are machine-local and not portable via git; skills are the better portable mechanism today. (Excluded as a technology/mechanism choice, not a behavior.) [p12], [p22]

  rejected-alternative: a backing Rust file per prompt
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: Prompts operate in a semantic space of abstract operations (e.g. add claim, remove claim) that know nothing about the storage backend; a per-prompt configuration file binds each abstract tool to a concrete implementation, and the bindings are generic so the backend (Postgres, SQLite, MySQL) is never hardcoded into the tool.

  endorsement: n/a

- statement: Tools are discovered, not declared - at load time the harness parses the prompt's Lua with everything stubbed, intercepts tool-registration calls, enumerates and deduplicates the required tools, fails to load with an error if any binding is missing, and offers a command that emits an empty bindings template for the user to fill in.

  rejected-alternative: the file as the sole unit of state
  endorsement: n/a

## Not converted

- Planning workflow preference: put everything in one plan, implement a working subset, subtract it, and iterate in tranches across the executor, gateway, and MCP service [p123].
- Repo bookkeeping preference: keep a status file (AGENTS.md at the root, not .mdc) that all changes must update so a fresh context knows the project state [p130, p131, p132].
- Doubt, unresolved: Lua will be used for general-purpose computation, so static detection of every tool call may not be reliable - this tensions with the load-time tool-discovery principle [p94].
- Open worries with no directive: Lua code going into an infinite loop, and tools gaining file read/write access through the Lua library [p92, p93].
- Design pressure, not a directive: many large per-tool schemas risk recreating the pydantic burden by shifting it into Lua [p84].

- The best engineers are lazy; the best kind of feature delivers everything with the minimal implementation (p231).
- Earlier design documents are bloat to be mined for ideas, not followed (p232, p233).
- Build in the smallest testable increments: Lua first, then args, then substitution, with an echo tool as the first commit (p250, p276, p293).
- Every commit carries tests, code review, and docs, and each commit makes progress on its own rather than needing a later commit to realize it (p292, p312).
- Keep a lightweight vibe-coding addendum and inject it into the context periodically to keep it fresh (p297-p302).
- Loading a how-to-write-prompts guide into plans works like a miracle (p299).
- Prefix caching is irrelevant at 3B model scale; tiny context windows are what drive the context engineering (p258, p259).

- Temperature should be zero for analytical pipelines [p105] - a usage preference, not an engine directive.
- The Observer API could grow a side channel for verbose debug logging [p105] - a floated question, never confirmed as a directive.
- Puzzlement that turning off thinking could ever be good [p106] - a teaching moment about model behavior, no rule.
- Architecture should be "lean, slender, and good" [p122] - temperament behind the normalization-layer principle, not itself a rule.
- If the store is a real filesystem, intermediate artifacts like evidence.md become useless files [p162] - a stated worry, no directive issued.
- Turnaround time on changes is painfully slow [p91] - impatience with the dev loop, no design rule.
- Reports should put date and model on their own italic paragraph at the bottom [p207] - a per-prompt output formatting choice, not engine behavior.

  rejected-alternative: special-cased parsing of horizontal-rule placement
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: Heading levels execute under identical rules at every level: an H3 falls through to the next H3 exactly as an H2 falls to the next H2, and "---", jump(), and execute() work the same way at each level, scoped to that heading's siblings and its children one level down.

  rejected-alternative: per-level execution semantics
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: Fall-through never crosses heading levels; the transfer from HN to H(N+1) must be explicit (jump or execute), and once the transfer happens the sibling walk proceeds normally at the deeper level.

  citation: 2026-08-19-0048-runvil-md-aug19.md [p41]
  rejected-alternative: implicit fall-through from a parent level into its children
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: execute() starts a new chain that runs to its end, like calling a different prompt whose pieces happen to live in the same file; it is recursive, and when the chain ends its reply is returned to the caller of execute.

  rejected-alternative: an asymmetric model where an execute-entered subroutine runs under JumpPolicy::Reject while a jump-entered one may jump
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: With subroutines, jump, and goto allowed, the same hazards as any programming language apply (infinite loops, wrong targets, unpredictable behavior); coherence is the prompt author's responsibility, not the engine's.

  rejected-alternative: engine-enforced guardrails on control flow

- statement: Fanout arms are not special-cased: arms can jump, execute, fanout, and list_from_section like any section.
  scope: core
  source: user-corrective
  citation: 2026-08-19-0048-runvil-md-aug19.md [p78], [p79]
  rejected-alternative: stubbed control globals in arms (jump rejected, execute/fanout/list_from_section failing loudly)
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: There is no limit on the total number of fanout items, only a limit on concurrent fanout.
  scope: core
  source: user-corrective
  citation: 2026-08-19-0048-runvil-md-aug19.md [p80]
  rejected-alternative: a total item cap (max_fanout_items)
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: Work lands in individual commits that can each be tested, and every commit pays down technical debt: review the whole of every file touched, combine or eliminate functions, remove the obsolete, and take available simplifications.
  scope: global

  rejected-alternative: none

- statement: Tests cover the absence of behavior (removed names erroring, blocked actions failing, invalid inputs rejected) and not only the presence of new behavior.
  scope: global

  rejected-alternative: testing only what was added
  endorsement: n/a

- statement: Captured bindings install after the shared replay, so a tool or model alias wins a name collision with a shared global.

  citation: 2026-08-19-0048-runvil-md-aug19.md [plans section]
  rejected-alternative: installing captured bindings before replay
  endorsement: affirmed

- statement: fanout's second parameter dispatches on type: a string names a list section, an array table is the collection, and anything else is a loud Lua error.
  scope: core

  rejected-alternative: silently iterating a hash-keyed table in unstable order

## Not converted

- Prefer shipping the permissive, simpler design now and tightening later with evidence ([p11]); in tension with the replay gate that was ultimately adopted.
- A correct generalization should simplify the implementation by eliminating special cases ([p43], [p60]).
- Ask for evidence before choosing an API shape, then answer from first principles when the evidence is already in hand ([p17], [p18]).
- Efficiency instinct: an API that forces reading 5,000 lines to extract 400 is wasteful ([p15]).
- Delight in elegant synthesis wherever it comes from; the jump-into-child-walk solution was found by the AI and credited as luck ([p66]-[p72]).
- Plans should stand alone ([p81]).
