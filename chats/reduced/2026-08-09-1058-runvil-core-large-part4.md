*Prompts p249-p374 of 451. Part 4 of 5. The Plans and Design Documents sections are in part 5.*



## Prompts



**[p249]** this makes no sense. spawn subagents and search the web for more about gemma and this toolcall stuff. because you are saying the model is unreliable and can't call tools? that's likes its one fucking job. and why does it have a non-standard invocation pattern/

**[p250]** Okay, this is what I'm talking about. I'm talking about we need a normalization layer because we can't be putting that shit in the prompt itself. Like, we need to, when, when, when a runvil prompt wants to call a tool, we have to know what to do for the model. So my question is, is this, how do we identify Gemma? How do we know, given the model, what shape of the tool call that it needs? And what's the API, what, what, how do we structure our Rust code so that we can abstract the normalization so we can have like little plugins? So if we, we look at the, at the model, we figure out how it needs to be normalized and then we apply a normalization layer. And I wanna have it all clean, and so that we can go on the internet, and we can, we can crib other people's code and make this shit work, 'cause I don't wanna be putting hardcoded crap in there. This has to work for all models.

**[p251]** what the fuck is "ContentFence" ???

**[p252]** Question, so then the runvil core is gonna inject the tool call the right way? No. It's gonna receive the reply and then it's gonna parse the tool call out of the reply, is that how it works? And then. And then on the next turn, the model sees its own tool call, and with the, with our response, how does that work? Explain that to me. So who's in control of the prompt? Does the gateway shape the prompt? Or is all the prompt engineering happening in the core?

**[p253]** This sounds good. Review the plan. How clean is this? I wanna clean this code up. I wanna have abstract interfaces wherever they need to be. I wanna make sure that we're not hardcoding anything. I want all this to be super clean. And my next question is, how does the operator set the dialect? I don't wanna have to set the dialect when you add a model like it should know. Like how do we find out what dialect the model uses? Is it in the GGUF? Is it in the Hugging Face card? Can we download the Hugging Face card and do a little bit of inference and figure it out? How do we what do we do? Maybe when we cache a model, we should download the card as well, and then the frontier model like Cursor, Opus can look at the card and it can make a choice about, it can go on the internet and figure out what the protocol is, and it can code up the the dialect if it needs to.

**[p254]** Can we put all the Rust code for the dialects? Can we put one, can we have one source file for each dialect and we put them in a folder called dialects? What do you think about that?

**[p255]** Spawn a subagent asynchronously and search the web for these elements of our plan, make sure that we're doing established practice, but I want it asynchronous. Don't cancel, I wanna be able to continue prompting. So spawn that task asynchronously, keep it going, and I wanna keep prompting. Are we clear?

**[p256]** Sing one, two, three! Testing one two three.

**[p257]** My question is, how does it know? Like, how does the tech work? Does it use the point six billion parameter model that the tests use? Or does it search for hardcoded strings? What you just said it doesn't do that. What are we talking about here?

**[p258]** review the plan, use @tools-public/rulebooks/vibe-rulebook.md and @tools-public/rulebooks/rust-rulebook.md

**[p259]** we have some modified files in the working set. the plan should look at the changes and commit them first, adding tests after and amending the commit if needed

**[p260]** do we already have the sidecars or do we have to redownload them?

**[p261]** can we make the sidecar a single markdown file with the same stem name?

**[p262]** show me the sidecar for the smallest model right now

**[p263]** hmm jinja? we are going to read that? how do we read the context length?

**[p264]** review the plan

**[p265]** Question: We have a problem. The prompt needs to have a way to say that the, a tool has to be called, like for example, the web search. If it doesn't perform at least one web search, that's a problem. So, I don't know, maybe we should have, let me show you some syntax, in the epilogue:

**[p266]** ```lua
assert(tools.calls["search"] > 0)
```

**[p267]** no to require_called, it violates the design principle of "do more with less".

**[p268]** and that count would be per-vm

**[p269]** update the plan

**[p270]** update the plan

**[p271]** failed tool call counts as a call, we are measuring if the model is performing not if the tool is performing. unknown aliases are hard errors with clear diagnostics.

**[p272]** "registered" is wrong - it has to be scoped

**[p273]** naming an unscoped yet global tool should hard-error

**[p274]** review the plan and run
'

**[p275]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\3.txt:750-753 error

**[p276]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\2.txt:131-138 but it is running

**[p277]** 8 minutes? but the model is already downloaded

**[p278]** still broken

**[p279]** assertion failed and we aren't getting the file and line numbers again

**[p280]** happened again and again no line number

**[p281]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\3.txt:1008-1012 failed. also, have you been committing?

**[p282]** figure it out

**[p283]** figure it out

**[p284]** --max-tokens and all that shit is gone, search the whole repo for obsolete switches

**[p285]** also the run id seems to not change

**[p286]** why it look stuck?

**[p287]** I thought we implemented the concurrent gateway

**[p288]** why is this so slow...

**[p289]** are we going to get a good report this time?

**[p290]** This is stupid how it waits to write all the json turn files.

**[p291]** well first we have to deal with the uncommitted local files

**[p292]** Commit uncommitted runvil WIP

**[p293]** Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself.

**[p294]** To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos.

**[p295]** Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself.

**[p296]** To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos.

**[p297]** so... its still going?

**[p298]** lets plan the dev change to write the turns as we go and the files as they come in

**[p299]** Write-through dump for runvil-dev

**[p300]** Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself.

**[p301]** To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos.

**[p302]** @runvil/briefer.store finally

**[p303]** I'm honestly not impressed with gemma

**[p304]** commit the working set

**[p305]** I want the concurrency now, plan it in both the gateway and the core.

**[p306]** why not concurrency 5

**[p307]** set gemma concurrency to 3 and set the qwen.toml concurrency to 10

**[p308]** use @tools-public/rulebooks/vibe-rulebook.md and @tools-public/rulebooks/rust-rulebook.md and @tools-public/rulebooks/prompts-rulebook.md

**[p309]** I'm confused why does common mention qwen or gemma? shouldn't those be in the qwen.toml and gemma.toml files?

**[p310]** I'm confused why does common mention qwen or gemma? shouldn't those be in the qwen.toml and gemma.toml files?

**[p311]** and fanout in core will work?

**[p312]** I mean the plan does parallel fanout

**[p313]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\2.txt:153-155 again missing line number

**[p314]** oh shit its hauling ass now

**[p315]** yep, plus I downgraded to Qwen

**[p316]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\3.txt:993-1017 what in the fuck is this shit?

**[p317]** ctrl+C doesn't work well with the concurrency change

**[p318]** fix it

**[p319]** Here is what I need. Prompt-engineer @runvil/briefer.md to produce the cleanest evidence.md. For reference here is what the original briefer prompt produces using Opus: @cabinet/_scratch/2026-08-08-briefer-cpp-alliance/2026-08-08-briefer-cpp-alliance-evidence.md .. Make it work for "C++ Alliance" and the subject. Then experiment with "Boost C++ Library Collection" and then "Bloomberg" Since you dont have the evidence packet for Boost and Bloomberg, use subagents and do the web search yourself, aspect by aspect, and keep fine tuning the runvil prompt until you get beautiful results, and get them quickly. Fast convergence. Tell me your understanding of this task.

**[p320]** cut Report out for speed at first and put it back after you have *thick* evidence. The target for "beautiful" is staged:
1. First, get equal to local qwen
2. Second, surpass qwen. more details. spawn subagents and search the web yourself, more broadly and more deeply to find out what is out there, and then prompt-engineer and context-engineer briefer.md to reach out. fan out more if you have to. go deeper with model turns if you think it helps. if something makes it worse, roll that back.
3. keep track of what works and what doesn't in a file, research.md not added to github, and we will go through it together when you are done
4. focus on individual facets and also the whole, keep improving
5. once you get past qwen then keep iterating until you go through 3 rounds of no improvement.
6. at this point, switch to the next subject. Boost. then Bloomberg
when you cannot make a meaningful improvement in any of the subjects, stop

**[p321]** also try to optimize for as few turns as possible in the web search agents

**[p322]** @tools-public/tools/briefer.md this is the real briefer, give me a short list of the items from there that you think should be goals for this

**[p323]** Source Log will be difficult, you would need to use append to a separate store file e.g. log.md. We can leave that out for now. At the end, you can try adding it. place a git commit every time you make a good step up in quality. later we can fold them together.

**[p324]** use qwen

**[p325]** @runvil/briefer.md:45 dont cheat! dont make the prompt biased to favor non-profits.

**[p326]** you could have said "corporate filings"

**[p327]** seems sstuck?

**[p328]** its done?

**[p329]** what did we learn

**[p330]** how tf can llama-server die? spawn subagents search the web

**[p331]** should we try Gemma again

**[p332]** do you want to try fixing the llama crash

**[p333]** Supervise local llama-server after death

**[p334]** Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself.

**[p335]** To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos.

**[p341]** did you commit?

**[p342]** Yes, obviously

**[p343]** okay lets try the qwen 27B?

**[p344]** rename qwen.toml to qwen9.toml

**[p345]** could thinking help us

**[p346]** well, we are on the way to parallel locked to 2 or 1 so, if we go down to 1 we might as well do A/B test of thinking on and off. We might discover that thinking transforms the output and makes it beautiful. You should test it again with Qwen 9. And Qwen 27. I want you to do that same long-running experiment where you adjust things until there are no more improvemnets. Use the same subjects:
1. "The C++ Alliance"
2. "Boost C++ Library Collection"
3. "Bloomberg"

**[p347]** after all that then try gemma.

**[p348]** I want you to run the plan and DO NOT STOP until you cannot make any progress on any axis reliably. Or if you get an unrecoverable error. Keep the code clean, do a review every 3 commits and fix one round

**[p349]** whats the conclusion

**[p350]** what does "upstream 422" mean

**[p351]** so Qwen doesn't really fit in my VRAM then?

**[p352]** could we make the slot bigger for 27B?

**[p353]** what is n_predict

**[p354]** could fine tuning help

**[p355]** are there other models to try

**[p356]** okay. try Mistral.

**[p357]** okay. try Mistral.

**[p358]** take down the gateway, delete the cached mistral,

**[p359]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\plans\gateway_web_search_upgrade_59d2ae56.plan.md add to the plan: after the search upgrade, lets try qwen 3.6 at Q4/Q5. parallel=1, context at least 64kb

**[p360]** what does "unsloth" mean

**[p361]** what do you mean "no thicken" ?

**[p362]** git add commit

**[p363]** run @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\plans\gateway_web_search_upgrade_59d2ae56.plan.md

**[p364]** seems to be stuck

**[p365]** how long did the qwen 27B run take

**[p366]** 3-4 min ain't bad

**[p367]** Hey, listen up, here's the deal: we have to work on the store. We need to be able to read actual files, but we also wanna have the virtual files, and they both need to be available at the same time, but the current model doesn't support that. So my question is, what do we do?

**[p368]** Oh, here's what I think happened. This is what I think happened. I think... In our effort to protect The machine From the prompt, we confused two things. One is the tool that lets you access files, right? Like read file, write file, replace, append, those are the tools, those are exposed to the LLM. Then you have the Lua API, and the problem is we confused the two. We assumed that, that the Lua should be sandboxed and that the Lua shouldn't be allowed to write files. That doesn't make sense. We need the Lua to be able to read and write actual files and read and write the memory files. And then For the prompt, there we need to tightly control it, like we need to every Every H2 section, when we inject the tools, we should inject what files it can have access to. We, we should inject the file system and what the memory files are or something. Like, there's, there's something here, we need to figure this out.

**[p369]** I wanna talk about this. We're not, you were very quick to edit the plan and we're not talking about it. Review the plan and then give me a good discussion. Explain the idea, give me the pros and cons, get it from the angles. I'm gonna show you some of my structured prompts and then you tell me how they play out. @tools-public/tools/briefer.md @tools-public/tools/diligence.md @tools-public/tools/staker.md

**[p370]** Oh, I'm thinking like, what if I wanna do like a tool that does coding? Like, what if I want a tool that refactors a source file? In that case, you need to be able to have like multi-turn access.

**[p371]** a general principle is: no parallel mechanisms. a single, small, well-designed set of primitives services all the needs. the tool scoping mechanism exists so we should lean on it as much as possible.

**[p372]** I think so but we have another design wrinkle. go back to web search. during testing, a model chose web_fetch before doing web_search, on its first turn. what if we had a way to express in the H2 (or H3): only web_search is available in the first turn, and then web_fetch and web_search are available from turns onwards? this locks the model to calling just one tool

**[p373]** One of my ideas is to be able to have a Lua function as a tool. Right? Because, like, for example, there's gonna be cases where we want the model to, like, set some data, but we don't wanna have to write a Rust function just for setting a variable. Right? We wanna be able to just inline the code. So you can set a function, a Lua function as a tool, and it can mirror an existing tool, but it can be like a front end. And so we can make a search tool out of Lua, which is a front end to the real search tool, and then we make it so that when the tool is called, that it does a tools dot add for fetch.

**[p374]** My thinking is that the user is opting in to the behavior, so that makes it ok. My question is, have a look at the source code. How much churn would it actually cause?
