*Prompts p134-p223 of 445. Part 3 of 5. The Plans and Design Documents sections are in part 5.*



## Prompts



**[p134]** actually dont reference any other design docs

**[p135]** get rid of example-diligence.md as well

**[p136]** what I want to support is this

**[p137]** ---
(YAML)
---

**[p138]** # Title

**[p139]** (text for human)

**[p140]** ## F1

**[p141]** ```lua
(lua)
```
prompt

**[p142]** ## F2

**[p143]** prompt

**[p144]** H3 as well of course.. fully recursive to H6

**[p145]** should it be an error to skip a heading level?

**[p146]** should we use AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md ?

**[p147]** what would we need to do an actual model call

**[p148]** we would only need call()

**[p149]** whatever we do with HTTP now, we can point it at our gateway later?

**[p150]** well I would want to use my anthropic api key thats in my system config

**[p151]** its in the environment yes

**[p152]** lets plan to go all the way but we only need call( "return", "Hello, world!" ) right?

**[p153]** so we are just hard-coding anthropic?

**[p154]** the base_url I mean

**[p155]** I have concerns that Call return with "deez nuts" syntax will be ambiguous in some contexts

**[p156]** How about fn_call

**[p157]** What if instead of
Call return with "x"
we say
call( "return", "x" )
?

**[p158]** I dont know. For humans, the other way reads nicely. And, there's something powerful about giving the model a handful of well-descrbied tools, a prose prompt, and letting it figure it out on its own.

**[p159]** What does the model do with Say "Hello, world!" and reutrn it? Would an anthropic model  instead write
<chat_block>
Hello, world!
</chat_block>
<tool_block>
it.
</tool_block>

**[p160]** subagent web search how tools are handled

**[p161]** oh this is saying, when I send the prompt to the model, in the list of tools I tell it for each tool "auto", "required", etc

**[p162]** this actually sounds perfect. "required" and provide only "return_value" tool

**[p163]** no but I think I am just spitballing here. the reason we use call() is so we dont put too many tools in context

**[p164]** we don't even need call() injected if we always fall through

**[p165]** So how will this work, the model will send back
<chat_block>
Hello, world!
</chat_block>
?

**[p166]** yes this sounds right

**[p167]** I have these. you will have to get the URL from @wg21-paperflow/SERVICES.toml

**[p168]** the AGENTS.md should have a command to always keep the docs up to date on every commit.

**[p169]** Just hard-code the anthropic url, since we are going to write the gateway later.

**[p170]** just remember that we will need a way for talktron to do a streaming session. so we need both streaming and non stream. how does this affect the plan?

**[p171]** i guess its not a big deal. keeping the connection open would help with streaming. for the session id how many bits for the key? 512?

**[p172]** are we doing Lua?

**[p173]** No Lua for now. Just make sure that every markdown feature also has the test

**[p174]** I dont see docs in the Crate layout.

**[p175]** The AGENTS says "keep all docs" what does that mean? is that ambiguoys?

**[p176]** what about the Rust docs the rst files?

**[p177]** yes of course

**[p178]** how much thinking for executing the plan?

**[p179]** Question: Is this using a markdown parser? We're using openai, right?

**[p180]** don't we need the openai crate, because it does so much for us

**[p181]** so our gateway would need openai?

**[p182]** streaming http chunked parser or something?

**[p183]** ugh SSE.. I wrote Beast I know what the fuck SSE is.

**[p184]** it sounds like we can deal with streaming later and by we I mean you

**[p185]** so.. which layer is responsible for the model-specific translation to and from the toolcall

**[p186]** my gateway?

**[p187]** I'm asking you if "my gateway" has to handle LLM differences

**[p188]** I feel like the next step is to implement the gateway

**[p189]** Oh, actually, it's because the gateway is a known quantity. Like, I know that I need, I just wanna move the key from the executor to the gateway, just to, just to have the crate in place, right? So that the shape, the framework, the skeleton is there, and. The reality is we're not sure about the control flow, so we could implement something and then we're not sure. So the gateway guarantees us something that we need, and then after the gateway, then we'll probably come back to the control flow, maybe, or maybe we do the MCP. Maybe we do the config, right? I want to make a little progress on a lot of things, instead of a lot of progress on a few things.

**[p190]** wtf is axum? why not share schemas?

**[p191]** I'm sorry I do not understand. Isn't it JSON ?

**[p192]** oh.... now I get it. Of course they should not share them. that's unnecessary coupling.

**[p193]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\plans\runvil_executor_tranche_1_08fd6c2c.plan.md do we need this?

**[p194]** lets plan the gateway. in the plan, plan the move to trash too

**[p195]** I forgot to load @tools-public/how-to/how-to-write-rust.md . does the commit we already placed respect these rules?

**[p196]** fix the top commit, test it, then amend it. do not fold it into the plan

**[p197]** I meant to take care of the how-to problems with the top commit immediately ratehr than folder it into the plan.

**[p198]** go

**[p199]** the gateway lets you assign labels to each endpoint?

**[p200]** no but "name" belongs to me\

**[p201]** hmm there's no point to "name" then - what's the point? "model name", shared contract, why is more than this needed?

**[p202]** I don't understand. walk me through the 2 models under one endpoint thing.

**[p203]** "name" is confusing then can we call it uid

**[p204]** amend the top commit

**[p205]** 1. is the gateway a separate app?
2. is there a user manual explaining the id and how all that works?
3. do we want to turn this into a windows service?

**[p206]** ok amend the top commit

**[p207]** Next, did you update the core to use the gateway?

**[p208]** What do you advise next?

**[p209]** Here's my question. How do I configure a local model? Well, we don't, we don't do we put that in the Gateway? No, I don't think we put that in the gateway, or do we? Maybe the gateway points to a local model.

**[p210]** Wait, why would I wanna have the model flip back and forth? That doesn't make sense. Why would I wanna flip between multiple endpoints? That's ruinous. You lose the, the kv pairs.

**[p211]** What happens if? We have the mcp, we know, we have the gateway. So if I wanna, if I wanna use my runpod from home? Then I have to use the gateway at my company's server. Because if we don't, then we don't because there can only be one, there has to there can only be one machine with the key, or else we can't enforce global limits because of vLLM. So that means I need a key that lets me access my company's gateway from remote, but if I also wanna do inference on my own computer, then I need a local gateway that talks to my video card. And I guess that will have V L L N or Lang, what is it? S. T. Lang?

**[p212]** a single executor run is not tied to one base url. each h2 step can use a different logical model, and each logical model can point to a different physical model.

**[p213]** why does the executor have a base_url at all? shouldn't that be in the model config?

**[p214]** the executor still needs a per-prompt file which maps prompt model ids to gateway model ids

**[p215]** Right, the executor is just a function call

**[p216]** so this means the gateway is a proxy

**[p217]** so, then I run the gateway locally, and it points to my runpod's openai endpoint, and it can also point to anthropic's openai compatibility endpoint

**[p218]** oh that was a mistake. it goes from my local gateway, to my company gateway, to the runpod. and the runpod has to have a whitelist

**[p219]** is this all in the design doc

**[p220]** update this @runvil-design/design/design-gateway.md

**[p221]** Okay, let's talk about the control flow. @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\plans\runvil_orchestrator_only.plan.md

**[p222]** I want to refine the call() model. The full call() has the different kinds. but what if a section is only going to goto with clear? we could restrict the tools further. we can just offer goto() that has no mode. this reduces pressure because the model doesnt have to pick a call kind

**[p223]** "decisions are the thing small models are worst at." but large models have no trouble, so if we have a complex section that has multiple ways to call, a frontier model will have absolutely no trouble. I am thinking we need both. the dramatically simple 1-concern call, and the swiss army call
