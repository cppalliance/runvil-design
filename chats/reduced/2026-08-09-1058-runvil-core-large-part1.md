## Prompts



**[p1]** context: @runvil/crates/runvil-core

**[p2]** Okay, help me understand something. So In rust, do the tests go in the same file as the implementation? What's going on here?

**[p3]** additional context: @tools-public/how-to/rust-how-to.md

**[p4]** is this crate idiomatic?

**[p5]** Actually no, Rust. I don't know Rust. And so like what's this pound sign with the shit in the brackets?

**[p6]** @runvil/crates/runvil-core/src/parser.rs:46-59 I thought there was also a trailing lua code fence

**[p7]** it is supposed to be like this

**[p8]** ## Name

**[p9]** ```lua
preamble
```

**[p10]** Prose

**[p11]** ```lua
epilog
```

**[p12]** ## Next Section

**[p13]** lets plan a nice refactor.  and I want a new design-core.md (I renamed the original) with clear instructions about the design. it explains the rationale and the features. starting with this one.

**[p14]** but what if there's for example a function that is used by more than half of the sections, they have to duplicate it?

**[p15]** this sounds better. so you are saying that it is concurrency which is tricky. fan-out accessing global mutable state would be a problem

**[p16]** should I be concerned about string lookups for names like "counter" ?

**[p17]** Explain to me the mechanism where the Prompt global lua is loaded and executes and then becomes read only, help me understand that.

**[p18]** that does sound nice. what if a function has no variables (i.e. an empty closure) are making the copies for fanout expensive?

**[p19]** oh so you are saying keep the function as a string, not even bytecode?

**[p20]** Sure but then we have a path through the code later which calls the lua parser which in theory can fail (even though it can't actually fail) and then we will have code which appears to ignore errors

**[p21]** yes this sounds correct

**[p22]** Should we make the lua regular? Like, for example, in the-before the first H2, should we require that the lua come before the pros just for consistency so that you don't confuse the A preamble with an epilogue in the H1.

**[p23]** I feel like H1 should be required, and anything between the YAML and the H1 is ignored.

**[p24]** by the way none of this has shipped so dont worry about breakage.

**[p25]** now show me all the syntaxes of the tool object

**[p26]** To get rid of the front matter in the tools, I don't think that's a good idea. I think that it should be in the, in the H one. I think that's where you put it, and I think that the reason is because we don't wanna have two ways of doing the same thing. Like, we wanna, we wanna always, we wanna create the smallest facility that lets us do as much as we can. So we shouldn't invent a new facility when an existing one can handle it. That's design rule number one. And design rule number two is that Never have two ways of doing the same thing, unless there's a really good documented reason. I want to get rid of the front matter and the tools, the tools and the front matter.

**[p27]** So now in the, in the H one, we need a way to be able to say, "Here's a sentence that describes the capability. " We call that the need string, and then the Harness will use embedding and a reranker to find the tool whose description matches the sentence. We already have a crate for that. And then when it finds it, it will associate it with that ID, so it becomes like a symbol. So this way, we'd, we the prompt doesn't have a hard-coded dependence on tool names. It only describes what the tool capabilities it needs are. And if the executor can't find a tool that hits that description that's unambiguous, then it gives an error. @runvil/crates/runvil-tool-picker

**[p28]** but binding local names is a smart play. it lets you do:

**[p29]** tools.add_need( "FormatReport", "Create a formatted Word document." )

**[p30]** And then in the prose it can be precise:

**[p31]** Use the FormatReport tool on the temporary file

**[p32]** Would this be good?

**[p33]** what do you think about this

**[p34]** would a reranker help? what does the study suggest? @runvil-design/spike-tool-picker

**[p35]** Also I think that mapping the same tool to two different Ids is a mistake. it should be an error. a design principle is that ambiguity or duplication is an error

**[p36]** Question: would it be a good idea after running the H1 preamble for the harness to do a cosine similarity on all the bound tools, and fail if two or more are too similar?

**[p37]** yeah lets do that. does this motivate changing the tool-picker crate to add the API ?

**[p38]** apply @tools-public/how-to/vibe-how-to.md to the plan

**[p39]** Do we have an observer-driven trace facility as a cross-cutting concern? That is, that every harness operation reports its activity to an optional observer which the caller can install and get detailed logging?

**[p40]** these events seem kind of pointless why not just have two strings: Section, and Detail?

**[p41]** Yes that sounds better. But note, that I have the idea of a fine-tuned small open-weight model which takes a prompt and calculates a short description. I'm not sure if we should use it. What do you think? @runvil-design/design/design-label.md

**[p42]** You fucking kidding me? Are you fucking kidding me? You weren't supposed to do the whole fucking thing and go... I never asked you to, I didn't fucking ask you to stop. I've been waiting all this time, I've been waiting three fucking hours, and I was supposed to come back and you were supposed to be finished, and you only did one step!

**[p43]** are you stupid? the vibe coder and the plan were explicit. break up the task into individual steps, each with its own commit, and then a code review and amended commit before continuing. never to ask the user.  so now you are doing all the steps in one commit?

**[p44]** reset the entire head

**[p45]** just reset and start over from the commit you already made

**[p46]** Here's what I want. I wanna plan some tests. Maybe we have them already, maybe we don't, but I want prompt tests. So here's what I want. I want. A series of files. Actually, can I put. Should I make a whole bunch of files test, test prompts, test them for me, or should we put the prompts as inline strings in the code? What would be better?

**[p47]** @runvil/crates/runvil-core/tests/valid/1.md here's an example

**[p48]** whats the difference between version and runvil

**[p49]** should "version" be required?

**[p50]** is it customary for mcp tools to state their version numbers

**[p51]** Question, question, where is the rust code that adds the tools variable into the lua chunk?

**[p52]** is there a plan

**[p53]** is there a lua command to log?

**[p54]** should we disable print, or remap it?

**[p55]** I feel like we need a log() facility and it would be helpful in tests to know if code reached a certain point

**[p56]** the log needs to be protected with a Mutex, and should we give each thread of execution (concurrent async instance) its own id?

**[p57]** that all makes sense. make a plan

**[p58]** dont forget the design doc

**[p59]** apply @tools-public/how-to/vibe-how-to.md to the plan

**[p60]** Happens when we compile the prompt and then we run it under the test, like I don't understand what happens, what do we do with this?@runvil/crates/runvil-core/tests/valid/1.md

**[p61]** would it be possible to have a separate test executable that has a downloaded small language model

**[p62]** so it would be its own crate?

**[p63]** Question I wanna do the, okay, so we have a separate crate, but I wanna make it so that, like, it downloads the model and then it just keeps it locally in a git-ignored directory or something. And so once it's downloaded, then we can run it over and over again. And I think there's value here because now we can do the end-to-end test and, like, we can check tool calling. Like, there's a lot of stuff that we're not gonna be able to test if we don't have a model. So we need a model. My question is, what's the smallest model that we could download that understands English and it can understand tool calls and is fast? It doesn't have to reason very well, but it's gotta be fast, it's gotta be able to produce output and call tools.

**[p64]** what is a "community GGUF" ?

**[p65]** why do we need llama-server why can't we use @runvil/crates/runvil-gateway

**[p66]** so wait, you are saying anything I download from hugging face needs to be exported in its own API endpoint provider like llama-server?

**[p67]** yeah but for a crate that runs integration tests this feels a bit clumsy. My intuition is for the "Rust bindings -> your process" but maybe I'm wrong?

**[p68]** if llama-server is already an openai shaped endpoint why do we need runvil-gateway

**[p69]** I want the new testing crate using llama-server then. no runvil-gateway smoke test yet. move @runvil/crates/runvil-core/tests/valid/1.md to the new testing crate

**[p70]** the crate should be called runvil-core-tests

**[p71]** how do I run the tests

**[p72]** @runvil/crates/runvil-core-tests/src/scenarios.rs:26-27 is this hard-coded to the choice of model?

**[p73]** @runvil/crates/runvil-core-tests/prompts/valid/shared-library.md:26-28 so what string does this return?

**[p74]** so can I write my own runvil prompt now?

**[p75]** I want to build my own prompt that uses inference. could I use the model used in the tests? how big is it?

**[p76]** No I want an executable that I can run with a command line argument and it will pick up what it needs from the directory containing the prompt or something. I want a fast way to run my prompts and build them up. How big is the context window of the test model

**[p77]** Okay, listen up, here's what i need. I need a development loop where I can edit a Runvil prompt, and I can run it from the command line, it does real inference, and then I can see the result. Maybe, maybe there's debug logging, and I can see what it's doing, and then when it produces an answer, I can see it get output. And then I need to be able to iterate quickly. I don't wanna have to create a whole bunch of infrastructure. I just, I, I need, first of all, I need a model with like a hundred and twenty-eight thousand token context. So what's the smallest open-weight model that has like a hundred and twenty-eight thousand context? That's not too big, maybe seven billion parameters, maybe thirteen billion, something that'll fit on my video card, sixteen gigs of VRAM, and it's got some decent reasoning. I need some decent reasoning. So how do I get this going? Do I, do I install it in the gateway? What do I do?

**[p78]** What are you telling me? You're telling me Runvil Core tests currently uses two fixed real model scenarios, or that you wanna upgrade it to do that? And then how do I switch between the two? Is there a command line?
