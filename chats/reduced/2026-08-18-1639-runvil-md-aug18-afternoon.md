**[p3]** Question: Should I treat the empty model text as an error? Because what about the tool calls? Do tool calls count? What's standard practice? Spawn sub-agents and search the internet for how orchestrators treat a model that doesn't, a model that responds with no actual text but still does tool calls, 'cause I feel like the tool calls should matter. That should count as, as output. In other words, why should we waste output tokens with the word "done"?

**[p4]** why did I have a fully empty turn

**[p5]** Oh, so you're telling me. You're telling me the prose ran twice, I was expecting the prose to run once and then the epilogue to run, but you're saying there's a loop there because there's only one. You're saying there's a, a tool called loop because it's the last prose of the section.

**[p6]** So wait a minute, then, I feel like if when we're in the, when we're in the tool loop. If we end the tool loop with no output but we have some tool calls at any point during the loop, then that shouldn't be an error, or should it?

**[p7]** Yes, I think you should implement that. This makes sense because it's, it's what you found on the web. And also, we need to fix the gateway not loading the environment file. It should try the environment file first. It should work just like the, it should work just like the sorry, the MCP server should work just like the gateway. All that flailing around that you did to find, to get the thing working is not acceptable, so I want it all fixed.

**[p8]** apply @tools-public/tools/architect.md @tools-public/rulebooks/vibe-rulebook.md @tools-public/rulebooks/rust-rulebook.md

**[p9]** review the plan

**[p10]** is Kimi K3 Low enough or should I bump it to High or Max?

**[p11]** review the plan

**[p12]** should I go for Max thinking?

**[p13]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\plans\empty-turn_policy_and_mcp_env_loading_07943109.plan.md this ran?

**[p14]** get this working

**[p16]** yeah stop



## Plans

### Empty-turn policy and MCP env loading

*Two fixes from the papergate debugging session: (1) accept an empty final tool-loop turn as a clean exit when finish_reason is "stop" and at least one tool call succeeded, and (2) make runvil-mcp-server load its name-matched .env file before interpolation, matching the gateway.*

# Empty-Turn Policy + MCP Env Loading

## Context

The papergate run failed because the prompt said "Do not output any text": the model recorded all sections via tool calls, then legally exited the loop with `content: ""`, `finish_reason: "stop"`, which `normalize.rs` hard-fails as `EmptyModelReply`. Separately, the MCP server resolves `${VAR}` only from the process environment (`std::env::var`), while the gateway loads name-matched `.env` files via dotenvy - forcing manual env sourcing at startup.

User decisions: empty-turn acceptance is **default behavior** (no opt-in flag); empty exit yields `reply = ""` (empty string).

## Part 1: Accept empty final turn after successful tool calls

Policy: in the prose tool loop, a turn with no tool calls and empty text is a clean loop exit (reply = `""`) when `finish_reason == "stop"` AND at least one tool call was successfully dispatched earlier in the loop. All other empty turns (no prior tool calls, or `finish_reason` missing/`"length"`/other) remain `EmptyModelReply` errors. Tool handler failures already abort the loop, so any completed dispatch counts as a success.

### Changes in `crates/runvil-core`

1. **`src/error.rs`** - add `finish_reason: Option<String>` field to `Error::EmptyModelReply` (currently only `detail: &'static str`, ~line 170). Update constructor usages.

2. **`src/normalize.rs`** - `empty_reply_error()` (line 119) takes the `finish_reason` from `TurnContext` (already bound at the raise site, lines 131-181) and stores it on the error. Update module docs (lines 1-7) to state the refined invariant: empty product is an error *unless* the tool loop accepts it as a stop-exit.

3. **`src/dialects/gemma3_tool_code/mod.rs`** (lines 171-173) - pass `finish_reason` through at its `empty_reply_error` call site.

4. **`src/execute/tool_loop.rs`** - the core change:
   - Track `successful_tool_calls: usize` in `run_prose_inference`, incremented after each successful dispatch (local tools lines 255-267, registry tools lines 276-293).
   - At the `client.complete` call (lines 173-185), catch `Error::EmptyModelReply` instead of unconditionally propagating: if `finish_reason == Some("stop")` and `successful_tool_calls > 0`, return `ProseInferenceResult { text: Some(String::new()), finish_reason }` (clean exit, empty reply). Otherwise observe `MODEL_TURN_FAILED` and propagate as today.
   - `run_tool_loop` (lines 112-115) needs no change - `Some("")` flows through, and `engine.rs:586` binds it to `reply`.

5. **`src/execute/engine.rs`** - verify `bind_reply` with `""` is harmless (it binds the empty string to Lua `reply`; `sys.reply_finish_reason` enrichment at lines 579-583 already handles the finish reason).

### Tests (update + new)

- Update `empty_final_text_fails_the_turn` (`src/execute/tests/mod.rs:920`) - still fails: no prior tool calls.
- `empty_truncated_final_text_fails_without_truncation_detail` (`mod.rs:955`) - still fails: `finish_reason: "length"`.
- New: tool call succeeds, then empty `stop` turn -> loop exits, section reply is `""`, run succeeds.
- New: empty `stop` turn with zero prior tool calls -> `EmptyModelReply`.
- New: empty turn with missing `finish_reason` after tool calls -> still `EmptyModelReply` (fail closed).
- Update `normalize.rs` unit tests for the new error field.

### Docs

- `crates/runvil-core/design-core.md` - revise item 25 (line 84), step 6 (line 111), and the observation paragraph (line 122) to state the stop-exit exception.
- `guide/src/prompt-files.md` / `guide/src/lua.md` - document that a tool loop may end silently and `reply` is then `""`.

## Part 2: MCP server loads name-matched .env file

Mirror the gateway (`crates/runvil-gateway/src/profile.rs:119-162`: `config_path.with_extension("env")`, missing file silently skipped) but **without** dotenvy's process-env mutation - `design-mcp-server.md:70-72` forbids `unsafe`, and `std::env::set_var` is unsafe under edition 2024. Instead, parse the env file into an in-memory map and thread it into interpolation. Precedence matches gateway behavior: process environment wins, env file supplies defaults (gateway gets this from dotenvy's no-override semantics).

### Changes in `crates/runvil-mcp-server`

1. **`src/config.rs`**:
   - `Config::load(path)` (lines 339-397): after reading the TOML, check `path.with_extension("env")`; if it exists, parse it into a `BTreeMap<String, String>` (reuse `dotenvy::from_path_iter` - iterator-only, no `set_var`, no unsafe; add `dotenvy.workspace = true` to the crate's Cargo.toml).
   - Refactor `from_toml_str` to take a lookup: keep `from_toml_str(&str)` delegating to a new private `from_toml_str_with(&str, &dyn Fn(&str) -> Option<String>)` that passes the lookup into `interpolate_document`. Lookup order: `std::env::var` first, then the env-file map (mirrors gateway precedence).

2. **`src/config/interpolate.rs`** - `interpolate_document` (line 19) and `interpolate` (line 56) accept the lookup closure instead of hardcoding `std::env::var`; `interpolate_with` (line 61) already has the right shape.

3. Hot reload (`src/watch/reload.rs` ~line 304) goes through `Config::load`, so it picks up env-file changes automatically - no change needed.

### Tests (`src/config/tests.rs`)

- New: `.env` file beside `.toml` resolves `${VAR}` (tempdir, `Config::load`).
- New: process env var beats env-file value (precedence parity with gateway).
- New: missing env file loads fine when all vars resolve from process env.
- New: env-file value does not leak into process env (`std::env::var` still unset after load).
- Existing interpolation tests keep passing through the process-env-only default lookup.

### Docs

- `crates/runvil-mcp-server/design-mcp-server.md` - add a section documenting name-matched env-file loading and why it uses an in-memory map (no unsafe env mutation).
- `guide/src/mcp-server.md:25` already claims one name-matched `.env` file - verify wording matches implemented precedence.
- `runvil.md` quickref - no change needed (already describes the intended behavior); optionally note the manual `set -a; . file.env` workaround is gone.

## Verification

1. `cargo test -p runvil-core -p runvil-mcp-server`
2. End-to-end: revert `local/prompts/papergate.md` line 44 to "Do not output any text.", restart both servers (no env sourcing), run `runvil papergate` on the P4222R1 inbox file - should succeed and produce the section list.
3. Kill servers, unset any exported vars, start MCP server bare - should come up resolving keys from `local/mcp-service.env`.

## Out of scope (noted, not fixed)

- Outbound history serializes assistant tool turns as `"content": ""` (`client/wire.rs:81-88`); Anthropic 400s on empty text blocks in requests in some paths, but the live run proved this shape works through the gateway today. Revisit only if it bites.


Todos:

- Add finish_reason to Error::EmptyModelReply and thread it through normalize.rs and gemma dialect
- tool_loop.rs: track successful tool calls, accept empty stop-turn as clean exit with empty reply
- Update and add runvil-core tests for the new exit policy
- Update design-core.md and guide docs for the refined invariant
- MCP server: parse name-matched .env into a map, thread lookup through interpolate_document
- Add env-file loading and precedence tests in config/tests.rs
- Update design-mcp-server.md env section
- Run cargo tests, then end-to-end papergate run with reverted prompt and bare server start
