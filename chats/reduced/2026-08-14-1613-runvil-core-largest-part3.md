## Prompts



**[p209]** where is the word grain coming from

**[p210]** run @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\plans\extract_runvil-dev_crate_87789848.plan.md

**[p211]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\4.txt:445-449 this has been running for a while

**[p212]** it finished but it says
2026-08-08T21:14:31.7825435Z - claude-sonnet-4-6
why ?

**[p213]** Why Sonnet? I thought we got rid of that.

**[p214]** create a new configuration C:\Users\Vinnie\cursor\local.toml with the bigger model

**[p215]** I thought we had the idea for gemma or smething. a 31b moe or 27b dense at fp4?

**[p216]** that's it. gemma-27b

**[p217]** what does license-gated mean

**[p218]** how do I set the hugging face token

**[p219]** I cleared it with Google use the official version

**[p220]** dont pressure me to run the plan. I want a hierarchy of files:

**[p221]** common.toml 
gemma.toml
qwen.toml

**[p222]** common.toml is inherited

**[p223]** the plan should clean up all the cache files if they are stale. same for the repo

**[p224]** what is this  crates/runvil-gateway/src/local/artifacts.rs

**[p225]** well is it committed?

**[p226]** yes obviously

**[p227]** where is gemma.toml

**[p228]** That's the wrong place. it was supposed to be C:\Users\Vinnie\src\cursor\gemma.toml. move all 3 files there now.

**[p229]** how do I know when the download is done

**[p230]** what does it mean to "provision" ?

**[p231]** still 0kb

**[p232]** why is it so slow

**[p233]** loading a 70gb model will be terrrible. can we show graphical progress maybe a bar and a spinner and a percentage?

**[p234]** lets do it

**[p235]** Gateway download progress bar

**[p236]** Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself.

**[p237]** To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos.

**[p238]** Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself.

**[p239]** To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos.

**[p240]** should we do the HTTP get in chunks of 1MB?

**[p241]** how do I run the dev

**[p242]** wow @runvil/briefer.store/report.md is filled with hallucinations and incorrect information

**[p243]** the smaller model performed better

**[p244]** Okay, here's what I don't understand. It's a twenty-seven billion parameter model. How can they put out a model that hallucinates like this? What fucking good is it? What's the use of the model if it can't be trusted? I don't understand. I must be using it wrong.

**[p245]** where did the hallucination happen? check the evidence packet @runvil/briefer.store/evidence.md

**[p246]** can you submit a turn to the Gemma instance running in the gateway?

**[p247]** play with it and figure out how to make it tell the truth when assembling @runvil/briefer.store/evidence.md

**[p248]** play with it and figure out how to make it tell the truth when assembling @runvil/briefer.store/evidence.md

**[p249]** this makes no sense. spawn subagents and search the web for more about gemma and this toolcall stuff. because you are saying the model is unreliable and can't call tools? that's likes its one fucking job. and why does it have a non-standard invocation pattern/

**[p250]** Okay, this is what I'm talking about. I'm talking about we need a normalization layer because we can't be putting that shit in the prompt itself. Like, we need to, when, when, when a runvil prompt wants to call a tool, we have to know what to do for the model. So my question is, is this, how do we identify Gemma? How do we know, given the model, what shape of the tool call that it needs? And what's the API, what, what, how do we structure our Rust code so that we can abstract the normalization so we can have like little plugins? So if we, we look at the, at the model, we figure out how it needs to be normalized and then we apply a normalization layer. And I wanna have it all clean, and so that we can go on the internet, and we can, we can crib other people's code and make this shit work, 'cause I don't wanna be putting hardcoded crap in there. This has to work for all models.

**[p251]** what the fuck is "ContentFence" ???

**[p252]** Question, so then the runvil core is gonna inject the tool call the right way? No. It's gonna receive the reply and then it's gonna parse the tool call out of the reply, is that how it works? And then. And then on the next turn, the model sees its own tool call, and with the, with our response, how does that work? Explain that to me. So who's in control of the prompt? Does the gateway shape the prompt? Or is all the prompt engineering happening in the core?

**[p253]** This sounds good. Review the plan. How clean is this? I wanna clean this code up. I wanna have abstract interfaces wherever they need to be. I wanna make sure that we're not hardcoding anything. I want all this to be super clean. And my next question is, how does the operator set the dialect? I don't wanna have to set the dialect when you add a model like it should know. Like how do we find out what dialect the model uses? Is it in the GGUF? Is it in the Hugging Face card? Can we download the Hugging Face card and do a little bit of inference and figure it out? How do we what do we do? Maybe when we cache a model, we should download the card as well, and then the frontier model like Cursor, Opus can look at the card and it can make a choice about, it can go on the internet and figure out what the protocol is, and it can code up the the dialect if it needs to.

**[p254]** Can we put all the Rust code for the dialects? Can we put one, can we have one source file for each dialect and we put them in a folder called dialects? What do you think about that?

**[p255]** Spawn a subagent asynchronously and search the web for these elements of our plan, make sure that we're doing established practice, but I want it asynchronous. Don't cancel, I wanna be able to continue prompting. So spawn that task asynchronously, keep it going, and I wanna keep prompting. Are we clear?

**[p256]** Sing one, two, three! Testing one two three.

**[p257]** My question is, how does it know? Like, how does the tech work? Does it use the point six billion parameter model that the tests use? Or does it search for hardcoded strings? What you just said it doesn't do that. What are we talking about here?

**[p258]** review the plan, use @tools-public/rulebooks/vibe-rulebook.md and @tools-public/rulebooks/rust-rulebook.md

**[p259]** we have some modified files in the working set. the plan should look at the changes and commit them first, adding tests after and amending the commit if needed

**[p260]** do we already have the sidecars or do we have to redownload them?

**[p261]** can we make the sidecar a single markdown file with the same stem name?

**[p262]** show me the sidecar for the smallest model right now

**[p263]** hmm jinja? we are going to read that? how do we read the context length?

**[p264]** review the plan

**[p265]** Question: We have a problem. The prompt needs to have a way to say that the, a tool has to be called, like for example, the web search. If it doesn't perform at least one web search, that's a problem. So, I don't know, maybe we should have, let me show you some syntax, in the epilogue:

**[p266]** ```lua
assert(tools.calls["search"] > 0)
```

**[p267]** no to require_called, it violates the design principle of "do more with less".

**[p268]** and that count would be per-vm

**[p269]** update the plan

**[p270]** update the plan

**[p271]** failed tool call counts as a call, we are measuring if the model is performing not if the tool is performing. unknown aliases are hard errors with clear diagnostics.

**[p272]** "registered" is wrong - it has to be scoped

**[p273]** naming an unscoped yet global tool should hard-error

**[p274]** review the plan and run
'

**[p275]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\3.txt:750-753 error

**[p276]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\2.txt:131-138 but it is running

**[p277]** 8 minutes? but the model is already downloaded

**[p278]** still broken

**[p279]** assertion failed and we aren't getting the file and line numbers again

**[p280]** happened again and again no line number

**[p281]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\3.txt:1008-1012 failed. also, have you been committing?

**[p282]** figure it out

**[p283]** figure it out

**[p284]** --max-tokens and all that shit is gone, search the whole repo for obsolete switches

**[p285]** also the run id seems to not change

**[p286]** why it look stuck?

**[p287]** I thought we implemented the concurrent gateway

**[p288]** why is this so slow...

**[p289]** are we going to get a good report this time?

**[p290]** This is stupid how it waits to write all the json turn files.

**[p291]** well first we have to deal with the uncommitted local files

**[p292]** Commit uncommitted runvil WIP

**[p293]** Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself.

**[p294]** To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos.

**[p295]** Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself.

**[p296]** To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos.

**[p297]** so... its still going?

**[p298]** lets plan the dev change to write the turns as we go and the files as they come in

**[p299]** Write-through dump for runvil-dev

**[p300]** Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself.

**[p301]** To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos.

**[p302]** @runvil/briefer.store finally

**[p303]** I'm honestly not impressed with gemma

**[p304]** commit the working set

**[p305]** I want the concurrency now, plan it in both the gateway and the core.

**[p306]** why not concurrency 5

**[p307]** set gemma concurrency to 3 and set the qwen.toml concurrency to 10

**[p308]** use @tools-public/rulebooks/vibe-rulebook.md and @tools-public/rulebooks/rust-rulebook.md and @tools-public/rulebooks/prompts-rulebook.md

**[p309]** I'm confused why does common mention qwen or gemma? shouldn't those be in the qwen.toml and gemma.toml files?

**[p310]** I'm confused why does common mention qwen or gemma? shouldn't those be in the qwen.toml and gemma.toml files?

**[p311]** and fanout in core will work?

**[p312]** I mean the plan does parallel fanout

**[p313]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\2.txt:153-155 again missing line number

**[p314]** oh shit its hauling ass now

**[p315]** yep, plus I downgraded to Qwen

**[p316]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\3.txt:993-1017 what in the fuck is this shit?

**[p317]** ctrl+C doesn't work well with the concurrency change

**[p318]** fix it

**[p319]** Here is what I need. Prompt-engineer @runvil/briefer.md to produce the cleanest evidence.md. For reference here is what the original briefer prompt produces using Opus: @cabinet/_scratch/2026-08-08-briefer-cpp-alliance/2026-08-08-briefer-cpp-alliance-evidence.md .. Make it work for "C++ Alliance" and the subject. Then experiment with "Boost C++ Library Collection" and then "Bloomberg" Since you dont have the evidence packet for Boost and Bloomberg, use subagents and do the web search yourself, aspect by aspect, and keep fine tuning the runvil prompt until you get beautiful results, and get them quickly. Fast convergence. Tell me your understanding of this task.

**[p320]** cut Report out for speed at first and put it back after you have *thick* evidence. The target for "beautiful" is staged:
1. First, get equal to local qwen
2. Second, surpass qwen. more details. spawn subagents and search the web yourself, more broadly and more deeply to find out what is out there, and then prompt-engineer and context-engineer briefer.md to reach out. fan out more if you have to. go deeper with model turns if you think it helps. if something makes it worse, roll that back.
3. keep track of what works and what doesn't in a file, research.md not added to github, and we will go through it together when you are done
4. focus on individual facets and also the whole, keep improving
5. once you get past qwen then keep iterating until you go through 3 rounds of no improvement.
6. at this point, switch to the next subject. Boost. then Bloomberg
when you cannot make a meaningful improvement in any of the subjects, stop

**[p321]** also try to optimize for as few turns as possible in the web search agents

**[p322]** @tools-public/tools/briefer.md this is the real briefer, give me a short list of the items from there that you think should be goals for this

**[p323]** Source Log will be difficult, you would need to use append to a separate store file e.g. log.md. We can leave that out for now. At the end, you can try adding it. place a git commit every time you make a good step up in quality. later we can fold them together.

**[p324]** use qwen

**[p325]** @runvil/briefer.md:45 dont cheat! dont make the prompt biased to favor non-profits.

**[p326]** you could have said "corporate filings"
