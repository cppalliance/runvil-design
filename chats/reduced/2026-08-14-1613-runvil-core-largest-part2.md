*Prompts p80-p208 of 511. Part 2 of 5. The Plans and Design Documents sections are in part 5.*



## Prompts



**[p80]** use @tools-public/how-to/vibe-how-to.md, @tools-public/how-to/rust-how-to.md, in the plan and during execution,

**[p81]** What do you mean 76s? wtf? over a minute per prompt?

**[p82]** README.md in the root of the repo should have short instructions with the dev loop.

**[p83]** what directory should I be in for the cargo command

**[p84]** Vinnie@VF-HOME MINGW64 ~/src/cursor/runvil (master)  
./target/release/runvil-core-tests dev briefer.md "C++ Alliance" --watch
bash: cd: C:UsersVinniesrccursorrunvil: No such file or directory

**[p85]** why the error what the fuck happened

**[p86]** This is kind of a trap, I used the wrong function and got no warning

**[p87]** I don't want this "```lua prompt" why do we need the word prompt? This makes no sense

**[p88]** @runvil/briefer.md:10-12 is there still a footgun if the user does
tools.add("search", "Search the web for pages matching a query.")
?

**[p89]** 1. show me this tools.add failure case that you think needs fixing, and 
2. I re-ran it and it is not failing hard it is doing this:
@c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\2.txt:403-406

**[p90]** my gut tells me there should only be one version of tools.add what was the thinking there?

**[p91]** yes but the turnaround time on these changes is fucking slow. can we do something to speed it up?

**[p92]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\2.txt:479-482 failed

**[p93]** gateway is running but this errors:

**[p94]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\2.txt:560-563

**[p95]** a failed tool.need should fail the prompt immediately with an error.

**[p96]** it worked?

**[p97]** @runvil/briefer.md:42-45 the logs are kind of useless for debugging. I can't see what went into evidence.md

**[p98]** evidence.md is empty...

**[p99]** if I am missing the runvil gateway token or whatever, I dont get a good message it just fails the tool bind?

**[p100]** what's the right value of RUNVIL_TOKEN

**[p101]** can I set it in my windows environment once and for all?

**[p102]** I deleted and recreated the terminal but it doesnt have the variable?

**[p103]** how big is the context on this qwen the test is using

**[p104]** evidence.md is empty again

**[p105]** temperature is supposed to be zero for analytical pipelines. let me ask you this, should we improve the Observer api so it can have a side channel for verbose debug logging traces?

**[p106]** I am so confused. how can turning off all thinking possibly be a good thing? turn thinking off? then what does the model do? doesn't analysis require thinking?

**[p107]** then it sounds like the prompt should control if thinking is on or off, not at the gateway

**[p108]** it should not be in the frontmatter. it should be like how tools are added in the introduction:

**[p109]** ```lua
models.add( "analyst", "A model suited for analysis", thinking=off, context=40000 )
models.add( "fast", "A fast model for doing web search", thinking=off, context=8192 )
```

**[p110]** and then in the H2:

**[p111]** ## Research

**[p112]** ```lua
model("fast")
```

**[p113]** Here's my question though. My question is, can the gateway support setting the temperature on can it support setting the temperature on an individual call? Can it support adjusting the context, or is that something that's decided when the model is loaded? Can all models support this dynamic choosing of the values?

**[p114]** plan the changes and I think it will include the gateway?

**[p115]** 1. C. Full cluster and 2. use your idea. Make sure there are user-facing docs.

**[p116]** apply @tools-public/rulebooks/vibe-rulebook.md but lighten it up so its not so slow

**[p117]** only one round of amend otherwise it finds too many things

**[p118]** @runvil/briefer.store/.trace

**[p119]** this has to work for all models. does openai do this work for us?

**[p120]** but this seems like a foolish duplication of effort. everyone who writes an app has to repeat this ceremony?

**[p121]** okay but is there a rust crate that already solves this? spawn subagents search the web.

**[p122]** Hey, listen up. I wanna build, no, no, keep going. I wanna build a normalization layer. I wanna write my program as if it was using a normalization library. We're not actually using one, but I want you to structure the API so we can drop in solutions. In other words, I want to normalize. I wanna have a normalizing API. Do you understand what I'm saying? Give me the pros and cons of this design, because it's ridiculous. There needed to be one crate or one source file that, that deals with all these little special cases so that we can talk universally. Because think about it, Runvil is all about using multiple little models, and you're gonna get this on Hugging Face, and you're gonna get this that on this API, and so it's gotta be flexible. We can't be burdening, we can't be putting a whole bunch of special cases everywhere. I hear what you're saying about this one targeted fix, and we should do that. Plan the targeted fix, but I want architecture, and I want it lean, and I want it, I want it slender, and I want it good.

**[p123]** evaluate my idea

**[p124]** First of all, the trait cosplay is not a big deal. if it happens its by definition easily removed.
Second the scope creep. A second genai. Well, yes thats exactly what we might need and if it happens it means we needed it. That's what normalizing means.
Third, I am having a hard time imagining when an empty model response is ever ok. It sounds like it should be an invariant. Empty response = hard fail always.
I'm not sure what request vs response means

**[p126]** Tool calls count as a repsonse, that is correct

**[p127]** lean vibe right?

**[p128]** Okay, Christian, I have a question about this. So you made a JSON file for every turn, is that the right thing to do? Is the trace, when we run, does the trace delete itself every time? Or does it just add? I feel like if we run, it should delete the trace, and if the developer wants it, he can back it up himself. What do you think?

**[p129]** evidence.md is empty again

**[p130]** empty again

**[p131]** show me

**[p132]** model binding failed

**[p133]** this makes no sense. the models need to be way looser than the tools. Shouldn't this use the tool-picker?

**[p134]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\92.txt:793-795 pdf hiccup

**[p135]** we got evidence.md but this is hallucinated:

**[p136]** Industry Advocacy: The organization actively lobbies for C++ inclusion in government procurement policies, defense contracts, and critical infrastructure projects where performance and memory safety are paramount.

**[p137]** its working now that I butchered the prompt

**[p138]** how do you force a model to do web search?

**[p139]** wouldn't the gateway have to support 3 ?

**[p140]** if we need the gateway anyway for web search why did we do this business with the core-tests? we should have just wired the 9B model through the gatewway

**[p141]** what happened? got an error

**[p142]** I feel like H3 should inherit the H2's model unless it specifies otherwise

**[p143]** now it dies with a 404

**[p144]** how do fetch tools usually handle this? search the web in a subagent and find out.

**[p145]** plan the change

**[p146]** Soft-return recoverable web_fetch failures

**[p147]** Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself.

**[p148]** To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos.

**[p151]** fix the commit log, do it right

**[p152]** should we add a gitignore pattern for all *.store directories?

**[p153]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\92.txt:735-740 what's this about now

**[p154]** First commit the gitignore change. Then let's plan an improvement. the H1 lua needs controls to set the caps. it should not go in the frontmatter

**[p155]** you mean raise the cap I think

**[p156]** do we already have a config object?

**[p157]** for now lets just set 200 max in @runvil/briefer.md YAML and I will run it again.

**[p158]** commit the gitignore change

**[p159]** here how do I inject "reply" into the context but treat it as untrusted input @runvil/briefer.md:57-58

**[p160]** is var persisted between H2s?

**[p161]** this is a problem. in this particular case `reply` is definitely untrusted. it is the joining of web fetches

**[p162]** here's my problem, if `store` is an actual file system then we would get evidence.md as a useless file

**[p163]** would this be the first time that the lua injects context?

**[p164]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\92.txt:1010-1012 it should show the line number

**[p165]** @runvil/briefer.store/.trace it should be deleting all the trace files on launch

**[p166]** yes make that change. leave the files alone for now

**[p167]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\92.txt:298-301 wtf happened??

**[p168]** but it worked in the previous run, what changed?

**[p169]** no thnat's not correct. we just produced @cabinet/_scratch/research.md in the previous run

**[p170]** I feel like maybe we need to bake the limit into the tools.add call

**[p171]** The question is what do we do when this budget is exhausted

**[p172]** oh... the tools are passed in a sidechannel to the gateway, and injected at the beginnin?

**[p173]** and what if "all the fetched content" is a bunch of 404s?

**[p174]** aborting the whole run is preferable. a hallucinated evidence packet taints the entire downstream result. see @tools-public/tools/briefer.md

**[p175]** it sounds like max_turns is not really on the tools its on the subagent itself so we would want something like config.max_turns(8) ?

**[p176]** this means we take ALL the tools away on exhaustion

**[p177]** is "converge" a term of art

**[p178]** look at the trace again and explain what actually happened @runvil/briefer.store/.trace

**[p179]** what about adding some temperature?

**[p180]** so the search did not actually 404?

**[p181]** @runvil/briefer.store much better

**[p182]** I phrased it this way:

**[p183]** > Search the web up to 3 times...

**[p184]** it doesn't feel like all 10 arms are launched concurrently though

**[p185]** how many can llama serve

**[p186]** How long, just a quick rough estimate dont get all precise on me, would it take to load a 1T parameter model on a blackwell B300 rack

**[p187]** would the gateway handle 10 concurrent web search?

**[p188]** why is the prompts output @cabinet/_scratch/research.md so thin compared to @cabinet/_scratch/2026-08-08-briefer-cpp-alliance/2026-08-08-briefer-cpp-alliance-evidence.md

**[p189]** @runvil/briefer.store/evidence.md but it got a lot of data

**[p190]** this is a problem, how do I close the gap with this model?

**[p191]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\92.txt:432-435 did I not compile?

**[p192]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\92.txt:1004-1007 fail

**[p193]** Away, I don't wanna match the tool description verbatim. This thing has to work. We have a whole crate that's dedicated to semantic matching, and you're telling me that it's not gonna work? No, no, no, no, no. We gotta figure this out!

**[p194]** yes 3

**[p195]** just do it in a single commit with one review pass

**[p196]** Understand, the test is starting a Promphor gate way, but I already have it running. Does that mean I'm myself? But wait, that's huh? Okay, what if it's already running?

**[p197]** its stuck

**[p198]** Oh right, it has to redownload. Did we get rid of the test Qwen?

**[p199]** @c:\Users\Vinnie\.cursor\projects\c-Users-Vinnie-src-cursor\terminals\92.txt:1004-1008 fail

**[p200]** its been renamed to RUNVIL_GATEWAY_KEY

**[p201]** I think this is all wrong. the test should not be lanching the gateway. it should require the gateway already exists, and that the gateway already has the configuration it needs. the gateway, the test, and runvil-core crates are all in the same repo what do you think?

**[p202]** Yes I like having the 0.6B model on hand without the gateway. Its a simple setup, and it allows for integration tests where inference actually takes place, which expands our potential testing surface without the bulk of spawning the gateway. What do you think?

**[p203]** yes. question: should this program which puts a prompt in "dev mode" be its own crate?

**[p204]** that sounds quite good actually. Yes I want a beautiful refactoring and to simplify the test crate. I want the dev crate to have nice documentation for the user. its own README.md in the crate root, design.md to explain the design choices. the readme should have full, friendly instructions.

**[p205]** Okay, but wait a minute. Context_max_tokens and no_think, those should be properties of the prompt, not the command line. Why are we putting that in the command line? The prompt has to specify what the minimum context size is. Like, that's how it's supposed to work. Model dot need.

**[p207]** update @runvil/briefer.md for me too, and make it put the date and model on its own paragraph at the bottom of the report, in italics

**[p208]** review the plan, apply @tools-public/rulebooks/rust-rulebook.md as needded, and incorporate @tools-public/rulebooks/vibe-rulebook.md
